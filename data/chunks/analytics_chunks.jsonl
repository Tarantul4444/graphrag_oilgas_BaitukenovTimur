И наша страна может извлечь выгоду из этой тенденции благодаря своим огромным запасам природного газа. Существует потенциал для улучшения внутреннего баланса природного газа за счет стимулирования внутреннего спроса и увеличения экспортных доходов при условии принятия надлежащих стратегических мер. Традиционно добыча газа в Казахстане зависела от операций по добыче нефти, осуществляемых в рамках крупных нефтегазовых проектов, таких как Тенгиз, Кашаган и Карачаганак. Для обеспечения оптимального энергетического баланса нашей страны газовой отрасли необходима собственная целостная стратегия развития. Для осуществления такого масштабного преобразования газовая отрасль н уждается как в значительных финансовых вливаниях, так и в фундаментальном изменении стратегий развития, чтобы стать устойчивым и надежным сектором, выходящим за рамки своей вспомогательной роли в нефтедобыче. Важность природного газа была отмечена видными спикерами на конференции CERAWeek 2025, организованной S&P Global . Министр энергетики США Крис Райт заявил на открытии пленарного заседания CERAWeek , что \"физически невозможно\" , чтобы солнечная, ветровая энергия и аккумуляторы заменили \"бесчисленное множество\" применений природного газа. Патрик Пуянне, генеральный директор французской энергетической компании TotalEnergies , заявил аудитории в Хьюстоне, что газовые электростанции также могут помочь странам отказаться от угля. \"Я убежден, что газ будет ядром энергетического перехода\" , - сказал Пуянне в своем выступлении . Он также отметил, что газ также может играть роль в поддержке электроэнергии, вырабатываемой такими непостоянными источниками как ветряные и солнечные установки. Ключевы е игрок и и запас ы газа Казахстан входит в двадцатку стран мира с крупнейшими запасами газа , причем большая часть запасов расположена в Прикаспийском бассейне . Норт Каспиан Оперейтинг Компани [НКОК], Карачаганак Петролиум Оперейтинг [КПО] и 2 Тенгизшевройл [ТШО] отвечают за управление большей частью добычи в рамках своих мегапроектов. CNPC -Актобемунайгаз и другие компании занимаются разработкой небольших газовых месторождений. Наибольшая доля запасов газа в Казахстане приходится на \"большую тройку\" месторождений: Кашаган, Тенгиз и Карачаганак [см. Рис. 1]. Разработка этих месторождений сопряжена с серьезными технологическими и экономическими вызовами, поскольку они характеризуются сложной геологией, глубоким залеганием и высоким содержанием серы. Важно отметить, что высокое содержание серы требует наличия специализированных установок для отделения серы от газа, что требует значительных инвестиций. НКОК, КПО и ТШО доминируют по за пасам, что подчеркивает крайне высокую концентрацию газовых ресурсов в рамках этих крупных проектов. Запасы газа, обнаруженные в менее сложных месторождениях, расположенных в других местах, имеют меньшие размеры и остаются важными только в пределах своих л окальных районов. Такая концентрация запасов представляет собой как возможность, так и риск. С одной стороны, она позволяет добиться эффекта экономии за счет масштаба производства, а с другой – создает уязвимость к сбоям на этих ключевых месторождениях и о граничивает участие небольших отечественных компаний в газовом секторе. Национальная компания QazaqGaz является краеугольным камнем газовой промышленности страны, поскольку она контролирует транспортировку, переработку и сбыт газа. КазМунайГаз [КМГ] играет важную роль в секторе разведки и добычи. 3 Компания Интергаз Центральная Азия эксплуатирует магистральную трубопроводную сеть, принадлежащую QazaqGaz , для обеспечения внутреннего транзита и экспорта газа. Функция переработки газа осуществляется через пять крупных газоперерабатывающих заводов [ГПЗ], а также за счет мощностей Оренбургского ГПЗ в России, который является одним из основных предприятий, пер ерабатывающих газ с Карачаганака. Фактический баланс газа Фактический газовый баланс страны в период с 2021 по 2024 год [см. Таблицу 1] демонстрирует как положительные, так и тревожные тенденции. Валовая добыча газа продемонстрировала явную тенденцию к росту за рассматриваемый период, что указывает на потенциал Казахстана, поскольку продолжаются инвестиции и разработки в области добычи газа. Однако этот рост добычи сопровождается увеличением объемов обратной закачки газа в пласт, что жизненно важно для поддержания добычи жидких углеводородов. Как видно из таблицы ниже, обратная закачка составляет более трети от общего баланса, что подчеркивает наличие огромного потенциала для повышения эффективности газового баланса. Для понимания контекста: совокупный средний вес переработки [21%] и экспортных продаж [11%] все еще ниже, чем вес обратной закачки. Обратная закачка, хотя и имеет решающее значение для поддержания добычи нефти, представляет собой упущенную возможность для создания более широкой экономической ценности, поскольку приоритетное развитие переработки и экспор та газа могло бы открыть значительные источники дохода, стимулировать развитие перерабатывающих отраслей и повысить общую энергетическую безопасность. Почти двукратное увеличение импорта в период с 2021 по 2024 год является еще одним тревожным сигналом для страны с огромными запасами газа и значительным потенциалом для развития этой отрасли.

Эта неотъемлемая связь означает, что объемы добычи газа напрямую зависят от планов добычи нефти. Высокий уровень обратной закачки газа, используемый для максимизации извлечения нефти, еще больше влияет на доступность товарного газа. Однако в эпоху, когда природный газ все больше признается ключевым компонентом мирового энергетического баланса , и некоторые видные аналитики считают его важнейшим источником энергии для обеспечения революции искусственного интеллекта , текущий статус природного газа как дополнения от добычи нефти представляет собой стратегическую уязвимость. Заглядывая в будущее, по мере истощения зрелых нефтяных месторождений и потенциального снижения добычи нефти, стратегический сдвиг в сторону разра ботки ресурсов \"бесплатного\" газа и оптимизации использования попутного газа будет иметь решающее значение для увеличения объемов производства товарного газа. Источник: Goldman Sachs Этот переход требует целенаправленных инвестиций и развития технологий, чтобы отделить добычу газа от ее зависимости от добычи нефти. Это разделение – не просто оперативная корректировка, а стратегический императив, позволяющий Казахстану в полной мере вос пользоваться растущим мировым спросом на природный газ и 5 закрепить свои позиции в меняющейся энергетической картине мира. Неспособность осуществить этот переход заблаговременно может"}

Улучшенный модельный контракт Исторически Казахстан эффективно использовал свои ресурсы попутного газа, закупая его для внутреннего рынка по очень низким ценам. Часто эти цены были ниже себестоимости для добывающих компаний, поэтому поставки газа фактически перекрестно субсидировались за счет экспорта нефти. Для стимулирования инвестиций в газовый сектор и разработку новых месторождений был введен Улучшенный Модельный Контракт [УМК]. Этот новый механизм ценообразования для \"нового\" газа [добываемого из новых проектов или посредством увеличения добычи на сущест вующих] устанавливает цену производителя как средневзвешенное значение цены внутреннего рынка [30%] и экспортной паритетной цены [70%]. Эта мера направлена на повышение инвестиционной привлекательности газовых проектов. Для углубленного анализа механизма У МК мы рекомендуем обратиться к Национальному энергетическому докладу KAZENERGY за 2023 год . Проект «Каламкас -море – Хазар» , совместное предприятие КМГ и Лукойла, является примером проекта, который может выиграть от УМК. Хотя ожидается, что УМК будет стимулировать добычу газа из новых предприятий, для реализации его полного потенциала и значительного влияния на газовый баланс необходимы дальнейшие реформы и инвестиции. Успех УМК зависит от его способности реально привлекать иностранные инвестиции и стимулировать отечественные компании к реализации более рискованных и капиталоемких проектов по разведке и разработке газа. УМК – это важный позитивный шаг, поскольку он признает глобальную ценность газа, привязывая цены производителей к экспортному паритету. Он предлагает инвесторам более экономически жизнеспособную структуру по сравнению с потенциально обескураживающе низкими внутренними ценами. Формула 70/30 – это разумная попытка сбалансировать привлечение инвестиций с доступностью для внутреннего рынка. Однако эффективность УМК не гарантирована. Формула 70/30 все еще может быть недостаточно привлекательной, поскольку компонент внутренней цены может ограничить потенциальную прибыль инвесторов. Фактические детали контракта имеют решающее значение, и невыгод ные условия могут свести на нет стимулы. Кроме того, 6 успех УМК в значительной степени зависит от более широкого инвестиционного климата в Казахстане, включая политическую стабильность и эффективность регулирования. Необходим постоянный мониторинг и корректировка формулы 70/30 для адаптации к изменениям рынка и поддержания ее эффективности. Поэтому, будучи долгожданным шагом, УМК является лишь частью более масштабной стратегии, необходимой для оживления газового сектора Казахстана, требующей тщательной реализации и дополнительных реформ. Прогнозный баланс газа Существуют различные прогнозные сценарии для газового баланса Казахстана. Например, прогноз S&P Global Commodity Insights для газового баланса Казахстана до 2050 год а представляет собой базовый сценарий, указывающий на относительно стабильный прогноз добычи. Прогнозируется, что валовая добыча достигнет пика примерно в 2030–2035 годах, а затем будет постепенно снижаться. Производство товарного газа следует аналогичной тенденции. Примечательно, что прогноз предполагает переход от чистого экспорта к чистому импорту в долгосрочной перспективе, что обусловлено увеличением внутреннего потребления товарного газа. Источник: Национальный энергетический доклад KAZENERGY 2023 Прогноз ENERGY Insights & Analytics [см. Таблицу 2] предлагает более консервативный прогноз, предсказывая снижение добычи природного газа в Казахстане с 20 30 по 2040 год. Важно отметить, что этот сценарий не учитывает несколько потенциально 7 значимых проектов, таких как «Каламкас -море - Хазар», «Кашаган Фаза 2 B и 3» и новый газовый завод для КПО, из -за отсутствия на сегодняшний день окончательных инвестиционных решений по этим проектам. Кроме того, Министерство энергетики Казахстана на заседании Расширенной коллегии представило планы по нескольким крупным проектам строительства газоперерабатывающих заводов : газоперерабатывающие заводы на месторождении Кашаган мощностью 1 и 2,5 млрд м3 в год, а также расширение КазГПЗ до 0,9 млрд м3 в год . Однако эти проекты имеют историю длительных обсуждений и задержек с реализацией, что добавляет неопределенности в отношении будущей добычи газа. К ним относятся как совместные проекты с катарской UCC Holding на Кашагане, так и расширение мощностей КазГПЗ . Таким образом, согласно этому сценарию, ожидается снижение чистой добычи, что приведет к сокращению свободных ресурсов природного газа. К 2035 году прогноз указывает на отрицательные свободные ресурсы, что означает, что внутреннее потребление превысит добычу даже после учета обратной закачки и переработки. Этот консервативный сценарий подчеркивает потенциальные риски для газоснабжения Казахс тана, если новые проекты не будут реализованы. Это напоминание о том, что полагаться исключительно на существующие месторождения нецелесообразно. Казахстану необходимо активно создавать благоприятную среду для инвестиций в разведку и добычу, упрощая нормативные процедуры, предлагая привлекательные нало говые условия и стимулируя технологические инновации. Это включает в себя целевые стимулы для проектов, которые увеличивают производственные мощности и открывают новые ресурсные бассейны. Прогноз Министерства энергетики Казахстана на 2024–2030 годы имеет более короткий горизонт и представляет собой более оптимистичный взгляд, прогнозируя увеличение как валовой, так и товарной добычи газа. Этот прогноз включает в себя вклад от существующих месторождений и новых проектов, что указывает на потенциа л значительного роста в газовом секторе. Прогноз также показывает устойчивый рост внутреннего потребления, но рост производства опережает потребление, что приводит к значительному увеличению свободных газовых ресурсов.

Данное выявление расхождений – не просто мысленный эксперимент . Оно несет далекоидущие последствия для энергетической безопасности, экономической диверсификации и геополитического позиционирования Казахстана. Мы считаем, что ключевым выводом является необходимость разработки гибкой и многосторонней стратегии. Казахстан должен выйти за рамки единичного прогнозирования и принять сценарное планирование, подвергая стресс -тестированию свою энергетическую политику и инвестиционные стратегии с учетом всего спектра возможных исходов. 9 Выводы Для обеспечения устойчивого газового баланса, удовлетворения растущего внутреннего спроса и сохранения экспортного потенциала Казахстан должен повысить инвестиционную привлекательность своего газового сектора.

Совокупная доля добывающего сегмента нефтегазового сектора республики соответствует 11.3% от ВВП , где газовый сектор имеет наименьшую долю . Несмотря на имеющиеся масштабные залежи в стране они характеризуются сложной экономикой и геологией, кроме того, большую часть запасов природного газа составля ет высокосернистый попутный газ, что существенно затрудняет разработку и добычу и делает стоимость переработки газа высок ой, поэтому цены закупа газа у недропользователей все время были ниже себестоимости добычи. В этой связи освоение запасов и использование такого газа остается проблематичным и высокозатратным , что привело к отсутствию интереса к финансированию и развитию газовых проектов . В результате отсутствия инвестиций и должной проработки вопросов развития отрасли правительством в стране не хватает мощностей для переработки газа, газовая инфраструктура требует модернизации, а основная часть ресурсной базы является побочным эффектом от добычи нефти , отчего стран а встала перед выбором ме жду наращиванием добычи нефти и ли производством газа. Потребление в стране растет стремительными темпами , в том числе из -за низких тарифов и намерений государства достичь целей углеродной нейтральности . Длительное бездействие и чрезмерное вмешательство государства, основанное на принцип ах нерыночного ценообразования , привел и к накоплению проблем в отрасли и дефициту газа в стране. Мы считаем, что страна слишком торопится с масштабным переходом на газ. В виду высокой капиталоемкости , длительного процесса геологоразведки , имеющихся рисков недостижения и неоправданности усилий и затрат , полное покрытие возникшего дефицита газа в короткие сроки только за счет новых проектов маловероятн о. Потенциал уже открытых и наиболее подготовленных проектов по добыче газа ограничен. Крупные нефтегазовые проекты не заинтересованы в поставках газа на внутренний рынок, так как цены на внутреннем рынке убыточны . Кроме того, данные обязательства не предусмотрены согласно контрактам, а переговорный процесс может затянуться . В этой связи недостающие объемы газа в ближайшей перспективе скорее всего будут покрываться за счет импорта, наиболее вероятно из России. Учитывая экзогенные риски импортных поставок, п ри текущих темпах роста внутреннего потребления, помимо усилий по вводу новых мощностей и расширению действующих, необходимо продолжить работу по установлению справедливых тарифов и цен, стимулирующих развитие газовой отрасли. При этом, учитывая разный уровень себестоимости добычи у недропользователей, подход должен быть дифференцированным. Кроме того , важна дальнейшая популяризаци я в широких массах принципов рационального и эффективного потребления товарного газа. Мы должны помнить, что Казахстан – это не газовая держава , ресурсы газа ограничены и требуют бережного потребления. Обзор газовой отрасли РК – страна входит в состояние дефицита газа 15 февраля 2024 г. Обзор газовой отрасли РК 2 Структурные перекосы в б аланс е газа РК Высокий риск энергетической безопасности активировал пристальное внимание вокруг необходимости реформирования газовой отрасли Казахстана. С каждым годом в стране все сложнее становится покрывать растущий внутренний спрос на газ. В структуре внутреннего потребления и национального энергетического баланса страны природный (сырой)1 газ долгое время находился на втором месте. Основной вес в структуре общего первичного2 потребления занимает уголь (в среднем за последние десять лет ~50%), ввиду богатой сырьевой базы, небольшой себестоимости добычи и как следствие доступных цен. Доля газа, с точки зрения использования, вдвое меньше (в среднем за десять лет 24%), однако пос тепенно растет, с 19% в 2015 году до 26% в 2022 г. По прогнозам IHS Markit, к 2040 г . доля угля сократится до 42%, а газа, наоборот, вырастет, до 29%. Поворотной точкой и основным драйвером роста доли газа в общей структуре потребления послужило принятие масштабной Программы газификации регионов РК (2014 г.), а также принятые обязательства Казахстана по снижению выбросов углекислого газа в рамках Парижского соглашения (2016 г.). По сравнению с другими видами органического невозобновляемого топлива газ являе тся наиболее экологически чистым и дешевым в РК, поэтому в ближайшие годы его роль в структуре потребления будет расти. В период с 2016 г. по 2022 г. первичное потребление сырого газа росло в среднем на 5% в год , тогда как производство росло в среднем на 2.2%, что привело к нехватке объемов предложения. Это объясняется несколькими факторами. Во-первых, по своей природе газ в Казахстане в основном попутный с высоким содержанием серы, что требует особого технологического оснащения на газоперерабатывающих заводах при его переработке в товарный газ. В РК всего два ГПЗ, отвечающих таким требованиям, которые полностью загружены, о тсюда нехватка мощностей для наращивания объемов переработки. Кроме того, значительную часть добываемого попутного газа необходимо закачивать обратно в пласты для поддержки полки добычи нефти, и решение по объемам закачки газа зависит от программы и планов разработки месторождений, как и в целом располагаемые объемы попутного газа зависят от объемов добычи нефти. Наконец, закуп газа у недропользователей для нужд внутреннего рынка осуществлялся по ценам , регулируемым государством, зачастую ниже себестоимости добычи, что дестимулировало добывающие компании к его производств у. 1 Сырой газ – любые углеводороды вне зависимости от их удельного веса, извлекаемые из недр в газообразном состоянии при нормальных атмосферных температуре и давлении, в том числе неочищенные природный, попутный, сланцевый газ, метан угольных пластов, а так же находящиеся в их составе неуглеводородные газы. 2 Первичное потребление – потребление природного газа, который еще не подвергнут процессу искусственного преобразования. Рис. 1. Баланс товарного газа Республики Казахстан до 2030 г ., млрд м3 Источник : Комплексный план развития газовой отрасли РК Обзор газовой отрасли РК 3 Согласно данным Комплексного плана развития газовой отрасли РК на 2022 -2026 гг. в 2024 г . будет пройден пик максимального производства товарного газа на действующих активах. Даже с учетом максимальных оценок выработки дополнительных объемов товарного газа от ввода новых проектов , с учетом стремительно растущего потребления на внутреннем рынке , образуется дефицит – потребности внутреннего рынка превысят доступные ресурсы газа на 1.7 млрд м3 в 2025 г . Это, помимо планов газификации населения, растущего потреб ления в автотранспорте, связано с низкими тарифами, вмешательством государства, большим объемом заявок от новых крупных потребителей, включая проекты перевода ТЭЦ на газ (ТЭЦ -2 и ТЭЦ -3 в Алматы), подключения к газоснабжению новых газохимических комплексов и новых крупных коммерческих потребителей (Qarmet, АО «Конденсат»). При этом в своем выступлении на правительственном часе в Мажилисе Парламента председатель правления QazaqGaz С. Жаркешов озвучил, что дефицит будет наблюдаться уже в 2024 г."}

Максимальный размер дефицита будет наблюдаться в ближайшие пять лет. При этом отмечаем, что прогнозные данные по производственным показателям разнятся в Комплексном плане развития газовой отрасли РК 2022 г. и актуализированной в 2023 г. Генеральной схеме газификации РК . В Генеральной схеме газификации представлено два прогноза – оптимистичный, который совпадает с основным прогнозом Комплексного плана развития, и базовый, в котором объемы снижены. Это еще раз подтверждает опасения по поводу снижающихся темпов наращивания ресурсной базы газа в ближайшей перспективе. Повышенное внимание к ситуации с доступностью ресурсной базы также явилось следствием необходимости поставок газа в Китай. В 2018 г . между странами был подписан пятилетний контракт, в соответствии с которым Казахстан взял на себя обязательства об ежегодном экспорте 10 млрд м3 казахстанского газа в КНР, начиная с 2019 г. В последние годы взятые обязательства РК не выполняются в полном объеме из -за нехватки сырья в стране. Поставки в Китай в 2022 г . составили около 4.4 млрд м3, за восемь месяцев 2023 г . – 2.8 млрд м3. За невыполнение обязательств в 2022 г. АО «НК «QazaqGaz» ( QazaqGaz ) согласно условиям договора выплатила компенсацию Petrochina в размере $40 .2 млн (Т18 .7 млрд) . При этом в 2023 г . контракт был продлен еще на 5 лет. В случае дальнейшей нехватки ресурсов для обеспечения внутреннего рынка, экспорт газа будет ограничен. Это повлияет не только на выполнение обязательств перед Китаем, но и окажет негативное влияние на финансовую устойчивость QazaqGaz т.к. экспортная выручк а позволяет QazaqGaz покрывать убытки от продажи газа (по нерыночным ценам) потребителям. Отметим, что Рис. 2 Сравнение прогноз ов добычи сырого газа, млрд м3 Источник : Генеральная схема газификации РК на 2023 - 2030 годы Обзор газовой отрасли РК 4 данная ситуация не является чем -то новым, поставки газа на внутренний рынок являются глубоко убыточными для нацоператора из года в год (прогнозный убыток по данным QazaqGaz за 2022 -2023 гг. порядка Т184 млрд). В 2022 -2023 гг. возникший дефицит ресурсной базы привел к нехватк е газа для экспортных поставок в Китай . Эта ситуация была решена путем заключения соглашения о поставках туркменского газа, договоренности с компанией «Тенгизшевройл» о перенаправлении части экспортных объемов газа на внутренний рынок, увеличения поставок сырого газа Карачаганака на Оренбургский ГПЗ для его переработки и обратной поставки в Казахстан (РК вынуждена перерабатывать сырой газ Карачаганака в России). Покрытие обязательств поставки газа в Китай, согласно обновленному контракту, скорее всего планируется за счет импортных объемов из России. Эти меры по принципу «тушения пожар а» не решают глобальной проблемы на казахстанском рынке и требуют принятия системных мер для обеспечения дополнительных источников товарного газа. Это требует безотлагательных решений учитывая неопределенность вокруг вопроса увеличения поставок газа с Тенгиз, Кашаган, Карачаганак. В Казахстане с целью решения накопившихся проблемных вопросов принят ряд официальных документов, отражающих вопросы перспективного развития газовой отрасли РК: • Комплексный план развития газовой отрасли Республики Казахстан на 2022 - 2026 годы3 • Комплексный план по развитию крупнейших нефтегазовых и нефтегазохимических проектов на 2023 - 2027 годы4 • План энергоэффективности и бережного потребления газа на 2023 - 2025 годы5 • Генеральная схема газификации РК на 2023 - 2030 годы6 В соответствии с данными документами приоритет и усилия Правительства РК концентрируются на ряде мер в целях обеспечения бесперебойного обеспечения газом потребителей РК, при устойчивом выполнении обязательств по транзиту газа, расширению ресурсной базы га за и увеличению объемов экспорта. Кроме того, созданная национальная компания QazaqGaz разработала новую стратегию развития компании, а также антикризисные меры для газовой отрасли РК, которые также отражают эти первостепенные задачи. При этом данные докум енты являются закрытыми, но мы считаем, что ввиду стратегической важности развития газовой отрасли в РК, а также в свете предстоящего выхода компании на IPO, необходим о публиковать указанные документы в режиме общего доступ а. На наш взгляд , принимаемые меры не принесут быстрых результатов и эффект будет растянут во времени. Реализация планов рассчитана на ближайшее десятилетие, при этом газ нужен уже сейчас. Крупные нефтегазовые проекты не заинтересованы в поставках газа на внутренний рынок, цены на внутреннем рынке убыточны, кроме того, данные обязательства не предусмотрены согласно контрактам, а переговорный процесс может затянуться. Объемы от уже открытых месторождений недостаточны для покрытия дефицитных объемов, результаты геологоразведки и ввод новых перерабатывающих мощностей также не будут быстрыми. Все мероприятия требуют высоких капиталовложений, что вероятно ляжет на плечи госбюджета страны , т.к. частных инвестици й нет. В краткосрочной перспективе дефицит газа в стране возможно покрыть только за счет импорта из соседних стран, несмотря на риски в плане энергобезопасности . Мы считаем, что страна торопится с переходом на газ. Например, Европ а, которая начала масштабны й переход на газ, после возникшего дефицита ресурсов вынуждена была вернуться к угольной генерации. Возможно , использование современных очистных сооружений при использовани и угля, развитие углехимии при имеющихся больших запасах будет реалистичнее для РК в ближайшей перспективе. 3 Утвержден постановлением Правительства РК от 18 июля 2022 года № 488 4 утвержден постановлением Правительства РК от 30 ноября 2023 года № 1062 5 утвержден постановлением Правительства РК от 19 октября 2023 года № 924 6 утверждена приказом Министра энергетики РК от 29 сентября 2023 года № 350 Обзор газовой отрасли РК 5 Ресурсная база газа характеризуется большой глубиной залегания, отсюда высокий уровень затрат на добычу и переработку Согласно статистическим данным по мировой энергетике компании ВР (2023 г.) «доказанные»7 запасы Казахстана составляют 2.3 трлн м3 или 1.2% от общемирового объема. Объем запасов остается неизменными с 2016 г. Казахстан занимает 16 -е место в мире и четвертое место среди стран СНГ (после России, Туркменистана и Азербайджана). При этом эти данные расход ятся с данными Комплексно го плана по развитию крупнейших нефтегазовых и нефтегазохимических проектов на 2023 -2027 гг., где по запасам газа у Казахстана 22 место в мире и 3 место среди стран СНГ (после России и Туркменистана ). В соответствии с принятой в Казахстане системой классификации (по категориям A+B+C1+C2)8 объем «доказанных и вероятных» запасов согласно данным Комплексного плана развития газовой отрасли РК на 2022 - 2026 г г. составляет 3.8 трлн м39.

Таким образом, большую часть запа сов природного газа в стране составляют высокосернистый попутный газ, который отличается большой глубиной залегания (до 5 км). Это существенно затрудняет разработку и добычу, и стоимость переработки газа очень высокая из -за процесса удаления серы и других примесей, а также последующей утилизации значительных объемов извлеченной серы. В этой связи освоение запасов и использование такого газа остается проблематичным и высокозатратным, и ввиду отсутствия интереса частных инвестиций вся нагрузка скорее всего опять ложится на госбюджет . На газовых месторождениях с небольшой глубиной залегания или не содержащих серы сосредоточены небольшие запасы газа. Добыча газа напрямую зависит от добычи жидких углеводородов После периода стагнации с 2019 по 2022 гг. (ввиду пандемии COVID -19, сокращения добычи на Тенгиз, Кашаган, сокращения объемов добычи нефти в рамках ОПЕК+ и ремонтов ) по итогам 2023 года объем добычи газа составил 5 8.8 млрд м3 газа, что на 1 0.5% больше, чем за аналогичный период прошлого года. Этому способствовал общий рост объема добычи нефти, а также принимаемые в последние годы меры по увеличению производства. За 2023 г . на месторождениях 7 «1P» согласно принятой в международной практике классификации 8 приблизительно соответствует международной категории «доказанных и вероятных» (2P) 9 данные по состоянию на 25 июля 2023 г. Обзор газовой отрасли РК 6 получили 34.5 млрд м3 попутного нефтяного газа (59% валовой добычи газа). 81.6% валовой добычи сырого газа обеспечили Тенгиз, Карачаганак и Кашаган. Одним из основных направлений Комплексного плана развития газовой отрасли РК является наращивание добычи сырого газа, что помимо трех крупных проектов связывается с перспективными месторождениями – как открыты ми, так и новы ми. В 2023 г. появились первые результаты - получен первый газ с участка Анабай (около 6.5 млн м3), наиболее крупный объем добычи и поставок начат с месторождения Аксай Южный в Кызылординской области (100 млн м 3 газа в год) , введены в промышленную эксплуатацию нефтегазовые месторождения Восточный Урихтау ( ожидается около 9 млн м3 газа в год c 2024 г. ) и Рожковское10 (порядка 1 млрд м3 в год). Все это открытые ранее месторождения, которые не разрабатывались в силу разных причин, среди которых относительно скромные объемы запасов, низк ая рентабельност ь разработки , неблагоприятный состав газа , низкие показатели дебита и др. Рис. 3. Добыча газа, млрд м3 Источник : БНС РК Вместе с тем, объемы товарного (коммерческого) газа составляют меньше половин ы вышеуказанного объема (41%) – 24.3 млрд м3 в 20 23 г., т.к. б ольшая часть добываемого неочищенного газа, во -первых, подвергается обратной закачке (35%) для поддержания давления в пласте и добычи жидких углеводородов , во-вторых, используется для выработк и электроэнергии и для други х технологически х нужд недропользователей (12%) , оставшаяся же часть отправляется на переработку . Таб. 2. Объемы добычи и закачки газа на крупных проектах, м лрд м3 Источник : QazaqGaz 10 Запущен в декабре 2023 г. Обзор газовой отрасли РК 7 Таким образом, объемы добычи газа в стране в значительной степени зависят от добычи жидких углеводородов. Прогнозы добычи газа в РК строятся в увязке с перспективами добычи нефти. Основной фонд нефтяных месторождений, не включая Тенгиз, Кашаган, Карачаганак, находятся на 3-ей и 4 -ой стадиях разработки с постепенным снижением уровня добычи нефти. Это говорит о высокой степени истощения действующих месторождений. Освоение потенциально новых участков недр (морские, сложные месторождения на суше) является более трудо - и капиталоемким. Основной приоритет на месторождениях Тенгиз, Кашаган и Карачаганак все еще отдается добыче жидких углеводородов, даже несмотря на предпринимаемые попытки Правительства РК стимулировать операторов увеличивать поставки газа за счет сокращения доли обратной закачки в пласты. Во -первых, разработка месторождений требует больших объемов закачки газа для поддержания и наращивания полки добы чи нефти. Во -вторых, процесс очистки попутного газа от серы (переработка, хранение и утилизация серы) является капиталоемким . В-третьих, отсутств уют стимул ы для переработки и поставок товарного газа на внутренний рынок ввиду низких закупочных цен на внутре ннем рынке. Кроме того, наблюдается недостаточное инвестирование в геологоразведку, активное развитие нефтегазохимии, а также грядущие изменения в структуре энергобаланса ввиду перехода к зеленой энергетике и снижения выбросов СО2. На наш взгляд , метод обратной закачки газа продолжит активно использоваться ввиду отсутствия альтернативных, экономически -эффективных методов поддержания пластового давления, а использование других агентов закачки скорее всего потребует дополнительных капитальных вложений, что негативно повлияет на экономику добычи. По экономическим оценкам объем выручки недропользователей от реализации газа на внутренний рынок не покрывает убытки от снижения объемов добычи и реализации нефти . Кроме того, естественное паден ие запасов и уровня добычи на месторождениях Казахстана также ограничивает потенциал снижения обратной закачки газа в будущем. Эти переменные не позволяют оперативно корректиров ать коммерчески е объем ы производства газа в зависимости от спроса. Все эти факторы ограничивают поступление необходимых объемов товарного газа на внутренний рынок на фоне растущего спроса и сохраняющихся обязательств по экспортным объемам в Китай. С оответственно, с трана входит в состояние хронического дефицита газа на внутреннем рынке . Стремительный рост потребления создает дисбаланс на внутреннем рынке РК Доля газа в структуре потребления первичных энергоресурсов растет. Объем потребления вырос на 40% в период с 2015 -22 гг. (2015 г. – 11,5 млрд м3; 2022 г. – 19.3 млрд м3.). Основными потребителями на внутреннем рынке являются – население (коммунально -бытовые + бюджетные организации + тепло) – 45%, ТЭК – 33% и промышленные предприятия – 22%. Относительная структура потребления газа в основных секторах со временем остается в целом стабильной – даже с увеличением совокупного объема. Принятые обязательства по сокращению выбросов углекислого газа и общий курс на развитие зеленой энергетики будут стимулировать переход на использование газа. В РК показатель использования газа в экономике будет приходиться на объемы, компенсирующие сокраще ние потребления угля. Уже начался процесс перевода крупных производственных объектов на газ, что значительно увеличивает необходимость наращивания и бесперебойной поставки ресурсной базы газа. Также рассматриваются инициативы по расширению использования га за на автодорожном транспорте, однако ввиду необходимости масштабного субсидирования расширения использования природного газа в качестве моторного топлива, вероятность масштабного развертывания"}

Обзор газовой отрасли РК 8 Масштабная газификация регионов стимулирует существенный рост спроса на товарный газ В конце 2014 г . Правительство РК утвердило «Генеральную схему газификации Республики Казахстан на 2015 -2030 г г.», тем самым был взят курс на расширение обеспеченности трубопроводным газом в стране. Основными целями данной программы являются повышение внутреннего потребления газа (в основном в коммунально -бытовом секторе), а также содействие достижению Казахстаном целей по сокращению выбросов в соответствии с Парижским соглашением по климату. По официальным данным Минэнерго РК уровень газификации в стране неуклонно растет. За 2022 -2023 г г. к системе газоснабжения подключено 412 населенных пункта, в которых проживают 628 тысяч человек. В 2022 г . совокупный уровень газификации в Казахстане достиг 59%, тем самым досрочно достигнув целевой ориентир 2030 г. в 56%.

Строительство региональных объектов газификации и распределительных газопроводов низкого давления на 80 -90% финансируется из республиканского бюджета, при этом ф инансирование проектирования и строительства газопроводов внутри населенных пунктов осуществляется за счет местных органов власти. QazaqGaz не участвует в процессах проектирования и строительства газопроводов и уведомля ется только в тот момент, когда необходимо произвести пуск газа и в дальнейшем принять на баланс в установленном порядке вновь построенные газотранспортные активы. При этом, срок передачи таких объектов конечным балансодержателям ввиду бюрократических проц едур11 (АО «Интергаз Центральная Азия» и/или АО «КазТрансГаз Аймак») составляет от 2 -х до 3 -х лет. В 2022 г . 736 объектов или порядка 60% от передаваемых МИО объектов требуют устранения замечаний. В этой связи, а также учитывая недостаточный объем переработки газа на месторождениях ввиду отсутствия газотранспортной инфраструктуры от мест его добычи в систему транспортировки и регионы его потребления , 29 сентября 2023 г . утверждена актуализированная Генеральная схема газификации РК на 2023 -2030 г г. Теперь задачи по газификации регионов будут тесно переплетены с вопросами транзита природного газа, расширения ресурсной базы и обеспечения имеющихся обязательств по экспорт ным объемам природного газа. Ожидается рост объемов выпуска нефтегазохимической продукции. В целях диверсификации углеводородной отрасли и развития продукции высоких переделов в стране поставлена задача развития нефтегазохимии. Сырьем для нефтегазохимической промышленности выступает попутный газ из ‑за относительно высокого содержания в нем жидкостей. Нефтегазохимическая промышленность на сегодня представлена рядом действующих и новых проектов. Таб. 3. Действующие и планируемые крупные нефтегазохимические проекты Казахстана Источник: Kazenergy 11 По завершении строительства объекты передаются от местных исполнительных органов в республиканскую собственность, после чего Комитетом госимущества и приватизации Министерства финансов РК проводится независимая оценка стоимости объектов, затем в каче стве имущественного взноса в оплату уставного капитала передается в АО «Самрук -Казына», далее в QazaqGaz и потом уже на баланс АО «Интергаз Центральная Азия» и/или АО «КазТрансГаз Аймак». Обзор газовой отрасли РК 10 По итогам 2022 г . рост производства нефтегазохимической продукции составил 43% с 190.1 тыс. тонн в 2021 г. до 271.4 тыс. тонн главным образом ввиду запуска в 2022 г. завода Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries (KPI)12. По предварительным оценкам в 2023 г . объем производства составил 515 тыс. тонн. Суммарный экспорт продуктов оценивается на уровне 240 -250 тыс. т., около 75% которого (180 -190 тыс. т .) пришлось на полипропилен KPI. В Казахстане основной объем продукции нефтегазохимии уходит на экспорт. АНПЗ, являясь единственным производителем бензола и параксилола планирует произвести 33.5 тыс. т . бензола и 205.7 тыс. т . параксилола в 2024 г. Основная часть продукции отгружается в направлении грузинского порта Кулеви для дальнейшей транспортировки в Алжир и Китай. Экспорт метил -трет-бутилового эфира (МТБЭ) сократился по итогам 2023 г. ввиду отсутствия объемов отгрузок в Р оссию по сравнению с 2022 г. Продукция отправляется в Киргизию и Узбекистан. В целях дальнейшего наращивания производства нефтегазохимической продукции в Карабатане реализуется строительство масштабного интегрированного газохимического комплекса (ИГХК), в который буд ут входить ряд новых проектов. ТОО «Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries Inc.» («Этап 1») В ноябре 2022 г . компанией KPI введен в эксплуатацию завод по производству полипропилена мощностью 500 тыс. полипропилена в год, использующий сырье ТШО (пропан). Первая партия полипропилена объемом 1 500 тонн, предназначенная для экспорта, была отгружена с KPI в 2022 г. Основными рынками сбыта в 2023 г. были Китай (89.5 тыс. т .), Польша (24.8 тыс. т .), Россия (1.2 тыс. т .), а также Турция и другие страны Европы. Кроме KPI полипропилен производит «Компания Нефтехим Ltd» (Павлодар) в объеме 70 тыс. т ./год (го мополимер). Завод по производству полиэтилена Второй этап («Этап 2») предполагает запуск крупного завода по производству полиэтилена мощностью 1.25 млн т . в год на участке Карабатан, расчетный объем капитальных затрат на который составляет $7.6 млрд Проект предполагает строительство: • Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC : установки по производству полиэтилена с использованием технологии MarTECH® ADL и предоставление соответствующей лицензии на производство 625 тыс. тонн полиэтилена в год. • Univation Technologies : второй установки полимеризации мощностью 625 тыс. тонн в год. Планируется поставка систем катализаторов полимеризации полиэтилена, включая катализаторы для полиэтилена высокой плотности (ПЭВП) и линейного полиэтилена низкой плотности (ЛПЭНП). • Газосепарационной установки (ГСУ) стоимостью $1 млрд и мощностью 9 млрд м3 в год, которая позволит производить 1.5 -1.7 млн т. в год этана и 370 тыс . т. пропан -бутановой смеси (состоящей в основном из пропана). Проект реализует компания ТОО «KMG PetroChem», 100% акций которой принадлежат КМГ. «Этап 2» находится на ранней стадии реализации. Готовую продукцию планируется реализовывать как на внутреннем рынке, так и на внешнем, в том числе в Китае, Турции, СНГ и Европе. По оценкам, спрос на полиэтилен на внутреннем рынке составлял около 160 -180 тыс. т . в год, но в 2022 г. он увеличился до 229 тыс. тонн. При этом"}

Основным сырьем для проекта будет газ с ТШО, однако все еще не достигнуто соглашение между сторонами по вопросам, связанны м с ценообразованием на газ и механизмам его закупа.

Маркетинговый план также предусматривает экспорт на рынки Европы, России, Китая и Турции. Основной вопрос опять же в доступнос ти сырья, его также планируется поставлять ТШО. Кроме того, среди других проектов следует отметить строительство комплекса по производству терефталевой кислоты (ТФК) и выпуска из нее полиэтилентерефталата (ПЭТФ) компанией ТОО «Almex Petrochemical». Проектная мощность по производству терефталевой кислоты 600 тыс. т . в год и полиэтилентерефталата 430 тыс. т . в год общей стоимостью $1 млрд Основным сырьем будут бензол и параксилол с Атырауского НПЗ. Технико -экономическое обоснование проекта завершено, ввод в эксплуатацию планируется на 2026 г. Вместе с тем, на наш взгляд , вызывают опасения следующие вопросы развития нефтегазохимии в РК: • Бесперебойное и достаточное обеспечение сырьем. Реализация крупных проектов интегрированного газохимического комплекса планируется на сырье ТШО. На сегодняшний день гарантированный объем поставок составляет 7 млрд м3, на практике по оценкам будет требоваться больше. Объем добычи на Тенгизе будет падать естественным образом после 2035 г., возможно изменение состава газа на этом фоне. При этом для безопасной реализации проектов необходимо сырье с постоянным составом газа, что маловероятно. В условиях имеющейся недостаточности объемов внутреннего предложен ия, необходимости сложных переговоров с иностранными операторами мегапроектов по увеличению поставки газового сырья на внутренний рынок сложно предположить существенное расширение газохимического производства в среднесрочной перспективе. • Рентабельность проектов при текущей форме собственности , структуре цен и финансирования . Возникает вопрос – в случае если обеспечение сырьем будет осуществляться по более высоким тарифам , будут ли такие проекты рентабельны. • Потенциальные рынки сбыта продукции проекта «Полиэтилен» при ожидаемом выпуске 1.25 млн тонн полиэтилена в год. Внутреннее потребление РК составляет около 300 тыс. тонн в год. Потенциальные страны потребления уже приступили или завершили реализацию собственных производств. Турция – начата реализация проекта по производству полиэтилена мощностью 2 млн тонн. Россия – в Уренгое начали строительство завода по деэтанизации мощностью 8 млн тонн. В Китае в 2025 г. планируется ввести в э ксплуатацию комплекс производительностью 2.5 млн тонн полиэтилена и полипропилена для обслуживания внутреннего спроса. Это несет потенциальные риски убытков по проекту, а также сложности в реализации готовой продукции. • Отсутствие вклада в развитие местных производств. Выпуск завода KPI, а также будущих проектов по полиэтилен у, бутадиен у ориентированы преобладающей частью на экспорт, тогда как потребности внутреннего рынка не покрываются. Учитывая ценовую политику нового завода , внутреннему рынку дешевле импортировать продукцию, чем приобретать ее у KPI. Мы считаем, что наличие крупных производств в стране должно вносить вклад в Обзор газовой отрасли РК 12 развитие местных более мелких производств второго -третьего передела и развивать культуру потребления на внутреннем рынке. • Обеспечение квалифицированными кадрами. Новые нефтегазохимические проекты требуют достаточно большого числа специалистов в области химии, инженеров и технических кадров среднего звена. Число выпускников по химическим специальностям год от года снижается, существует проблема качества подготовки. Отечественные высококвалифицированные специалисты уезжают на зарубежные проекты, где оплата намного выше, чем в Казахстане. Следовательно обеспечение кадрами займет определенное время для их подготовки, при этом зара ботные платы должны быть привлекательными для опытных специалистов. Цены на внутреннем рынке не выгодны ни для недропользователей, ни для национального оператора QazaqGaz На внутреннем рынке газа Р К можно выделить две ключевые проблемы, связанные с ценообразованием. В первую очередь ц ены закупа газа у недропользователей все время были ниже себестоимости добычи . Вся цепочка создания стоимости товарного газа (закупочная цена у недропользователя, услуги по транспортировке, оптовые и розничные цены) устанавливается МЭ и КРЕМ МНЭ РК в соответствии с действующим законодательством РК. Цена на покупку товарного газа у недропользователей рассчитыва ется по формуле: себестоимость добычи + расходы на подготовку + затраты на транспортировку до места продажи Нацоператору + рентабельност ь 10%. Однако для добывающих компаний такая формула ценообразования не является достаточно маржинальной для того, чтобы увеличивать объемы переработки попутного газа в товарный газ. В 2023 г . утверждена новая формула для новых газовых или действующих проектов, на которых планируется увеличение добычи. Согласно принятых поправок закупочная цена будет состоять на 70% из стоимости экспортного газа на границе Казахстана и Китая, на 30% – от предельных оптовых цен на внутреннем рынке. Средняя закупочная цена на газ в Казахстане составляет около $40 -50 за 1 тыс. м3, новая формула позволит компаниям продавать газ за $110 -120 (рост в 2.5 раза). Эта мера , на наш взгляд , очевидно улучшит текущую ситуацию и как минимум позволит привлечь внимание инвесторов для оценки целесообразности возможных инвестиций в геологоразведку и освоение залежей газа. В противном случае это все обернется дополнительной нагрузкой на госбюджет страны. Вторым острым вопросом на внутреннем рынке является низкая цена реализации товарного газа для национального оператора. Убытки связаны с тем, что себестоимость закупа газа у недропользователей в Т25.2 тыс. за тыс. м3 превышает оптовую цену реализации газа газораспределительным компаниям, которая составляет Т14.3 тыс. То есть с каждой тысячи кубических метров компания теряе т Т11 тыс. Учитывая все торговые операции группы, в 2022 г . убыток от реализации газа на внутренний рынок состави л Т176 млрд , тогда как прибыль от реализации газа на экспорт составила Т113.9 млрд (общий валовый убыток – Т62 млрд ). За период с 2015 по 2021 г г. убыток QazaqGaz составил Т 587 млрд Таб. 4. Прибыль от реализации газа на экспорт не покрывает убытки на внутреннем рынке Источник : QazaqGaz Обзор газовой отрасли РК 13 Таким образом, о птовая и розничная цена реализации газа находятся на уровне ниже себестоимости сбыта. Продажа на внутренний рынок субсидируется доходами от экспорта, которые исчерпаны в связи с возникшим дефицитом сырья. В этой"}

Средняя розничная цена на товарный газ для населения увеличилась с 22 тенге за 1 м3 на 2.7 тенге . При этом стоимость газа будет повышаться ежегодно в течение пяти лет. В зависимости от региона размер роста будет разным. • Отдельный, более высокий тариф , утвержден для промышленных потребителей, покупающих сырье для производства компримированного и (или) сжиженного природного газа. • Введены две новые категории потребителей – крупные коммерческие предприятия и майнеры, которым газ будет поставля ться по рыночной стоимости, с привязкой к ценам экспортных поставок газа в Китай. Вместе с тем, изначально повышение предельных оптовых цен не должно было превышать 15% в течение одного календарного года. Однако Минэнерго намерено повысить этот порог до 20%.

В этой связи для наращивания объемов товарного газа требуется строительство дополнительных газоперерабатывающих мощностей с новыми современными технологиями. Остальные имеющиеся газоперерабатывающие мощности являются менее технологически оснащенными. Оренбургский ГПЗ в последнее время сообщает о возникших технологических сложностях с приемом дополнительных объемов высокосернистого Карачаганакского газа, что также служит стимулом строительства новых мощностей в РК. Газотранспортная инфраструктура расширяется, однако имеющаяся требует капремонтов Ранее , как наследи е советских времен , магистральный трубопровод в Казахстане был технологически не соединен, что предотвращало его использование для откачки в южные и северные регионы недорогого газа, произведенного в западных регионах страны. В настоящее время все магистральные газопроводы Казахстана объединены в единую газотранспортную систему, включающую газопроводы Союз, Средняя Азия -Центр (САЦ), Бухара -Урал, Ташкент -Бишкек -Алматы и Газли -Шымкент, а также ББШ и Центральная Азия -Китай. Расширение локальных газопроводных распределительных сетей в Казахстане продолжается на протяжении десяти лет или более, но его темпы ускорились ввиду начал а реализации масштабной газификации страны. Среди крупных проектов по модернизации, укреплению и строительству газовой инфраструктуры, реализуемых QazaqGaz , отметим : • В 2023 г . завершено строительство лупинга14 магистрального газопровода «Макат -Северный Кавказ» ( мощность 7.5 млрд м3 в год ) для обеспечения энергетической безопасности Атырауской области , включая снабжение нефтегазохимических проектов . Газ в нее предположительно будет поступать главным образом с ГПЗ на месторождении Тенгиз через САЦ. • Строится соединение между Кашаганом и газопроводом Макат -Северный Кавказ, для транспортировки переработанного газа с нового ГПЗ на Кашагане. • В 2027 г. планируется завершить строительство второй нитки газопровода «Бейнеу -Бозой - Шымкент » (ББШ -2), мощность ю от 10 млрд м3 в год. ББШ-2 предназначается для снабжения новых крупных коммерческих потребителей в южном и центральном регионах Казахстана, включая ТЭЦ -2 в Алматы, ERG и Qarmet. • Запущена вторая нитка «Бейнеу -Жанаозен -2» с целью повышения н адежност и газоснабжения населенных пунктов Мангистауской области, электростанции ТОО «МАЭК - Казатомпром» и других крупных предприятий. Газ будет поступать путем реверсной транспортировки (в направлении с севера на юг) из САЦ . • Введен в эксплуатацию газопровод от села Курык до местности Сарша и курортной зоны «Теплый пляж», что позволило газифицировать туристические и развлекательные объекты на побережье Каспийского моря и опреснительный завод. • Газопровод Бухара -Урал до Актобе для увеличения поставок газа в Актобе и близлежащи е населенны е пункт ы, учитывая практически полную изношенность первых двух ниток (отвода) газопровода. В дополнение к проектам, официально объявленным QazaqGaz, переговоры между Казахстаном, Россией и Узбекистаном относительно создания региональной структуры газоснабжения могут привести к расширению существующих казахстанских газотранспортных мощностей или даже к строительству абсолютно новых газопроводов. Развивающиеся переговоры между странами скорее 13 КПО отправляет около 8 -9 млрд м3 сырого (сернистого) газа в год на Оренбургский ГПЗ для переработки в рамках действующего договора купли -продажи газа сроком до 2038 года 14 участок трубопровода, прокладываемый параллельно основному, позволяющий увеличить его пропускную способность Обзор газовой отрасли РК 15 всего приведут к тому, что Казахстан будет осуществлять транзит, при этом экспорт останется только в Китай за счет импорта из России. Вместе с тем, имеющаяся газотранспортная инфраструктура, которая была заложена в советское время, характеризуется высокой степенью изношенности, что неблагоприятно сказывается на пропускной способности. Средний уровень износа по данным АО «Интергаз Центральная Азия» (ИЦА), составляет более 70%. От технического состояния инфраструктуры зависит объем прокачки газа и в целом энергетическая безопасность внутреннего рынка РК. Согласно плану модернизации газотранспортной системы группы QazaqGaz к 2030 г . уровень износа активов должен сн изиться до 25%. Устранение проблемы изношенности требует значительных капвложений . Отметим, что финансировать такой объем ремонтных работ невозможно только за счет текущих капитальных затрат, необходимо задействовать дополнительные источники финансирования. Нацоператор скорее всего рассчитывает на финансирование за счет ожидаемого снижения убытков от поставок на внутренний рынок как следствие проводим ых реформ ценообразования, использ ование части доходов от экспорта . Однако мы считаем, что без господдержки реализовать запланированные мероприятия не представится возможным. Растущую потребность планируется покрыть за счет ввода в эксплуатацию новых месторождений и перерабатывающих мощностей Увеличение ресурсной базы газа в стране планируется осуществлять через несколько направлений.

В стране имеется высокий потенциал разведки для наращивания ресурсной базы газа. Национальные операторы АО НК «КазМунайГаз» и АО НК « Qazaqgaz » планируют к разработке перспективные месторождения, которые в совокупности могут дать прирост добычи природного газа до 4 .6 млрд м3 к 2030 г. Таб. 6 Перспективные газовые месторождения в Казахстане Источник : QazaqGaz , КМГ Основной вклад будет внесен КазМунайГазом, который планиру ет увеличить выпуск с 2.2 млрд м3 в 2022 г . до 6.7 млрд м3 в 2030 г . (+4.5 млрд м3) как за счет действующих активов, так и за счет освоения новых . В 2023 г. АО НК « Qazaqgaz » уже получил первые объемы на месторождении Анабай, ожидает ввод а в эксплуатацию месторождений Придорожное и Барханная до 2027 г . Ранее эти месторождения не разрабатывались ввиду относительно небольших объемов запасов и отсутствии инфраструктуры. Также в рамках поиска новых участков получена лицензия на геологическое изучение недр на участке «Аккудук» и подписано Соглашение о перспективны х участка х для геологоразведочных работ, определенны х QazaqGaz (Прикаспийский, Мангышлакский, Карагандинский угольный ба ссейны). Обзор газовой отрасли РК 16 Кроме того, планируется провести доразведку на перспективных месторождениях Актоты, Орталык, Кайран, Лебяжий, Южное Придорожное, Ракушечное, С. Нуржанов, Южный Урихтау, Каламкас - суша, Хвалынское и Имашевское, геологические запасы которых могут достичь 950 млрд м3. Увеличение инвестиционной привлекательности геологоразведочных проектов . Правительством разрабатывается ряд преференций в целях привлечения стратегических партнеров для реализации проектов геологоразведки и разработки новых месторождений. В целях снижения затрат на разведку и добычу разработан механизм Ул учшенного модельного контракта (УМК) , который обеспечивает стабильность и более низкий уровень налогов. На условиях УМК уже привлечен ы российские компании «ЛУКОЙЛ» в качестве партнера (50/50) на месторождениях Каламкас -море, Хазар и Ауэзов в Каспийском море и «Татнефть» на мес торождение Каратон -Саркамыс (на условиях кэрри -финансирования). Другим важным нововведением в целях увеличения цены закупа газа у производителей является утверждение новой формулы ценообразования . С конца 2022 г . новая цена для закупки газа15 у производителей представля ет собой взвешенную сумму цены на внутреннем рынке и цены экспортного паритета, скорректированную с учетом расходов на транспортировку, комиссии QazaqGaz и индекса сложности месторождения. Стимулирование недропользователей к сокращению обратной закачки и сжигани я попутного газа на факелах . Комплекс стимулирующих подходов , помимо предоставления привлекательной закупочной цены, включает в себя : - предоставление фискальных преференций недропользователям , т.к. стимулирующей формулы недостаточно для обеспечения необходимой рентабельности газовых проектов ; - совместн ая реализаци я проектов по переработке газа ; - введение новых категорий крупных промышленных потребителей и майнеров, которым газ будет поставляться по рыночным ценам, с привязкой к ценам экспортных поставок товарного газа в КНР; - социально -справедливая реформа ценообразования (поэтапное повышение цен с защитой социальн о-уязвимых категорий населения) . Для обеспечения рентабельности на уровне не менее 12% разработан ряд преференций, которые будут применяться к новым газовым проектам или проектам, на которых планируется рост добычи газа. Проекты добычи газа могут быть освобождены от налога на имущество, на добычу полезных ископаемых (НДПИ), добавленную стоимость (НДС), экспортных пошлин (ЭТП) и подоходных налогов (КПН ) на 10 лет с даты начала добычи, а также предоставление права перехода на альтернативный налог на недропользование (АНН) . Аналогичные льготы могут быть применены к проектам по переработке газа, плюс нулевая пошлина при импорте оборудования и реагентов, возможность полностью эк спортировать побочные продукты (сжиженный углеводородный газ и конденсат ). Также рассматривается возможность установки счетчиков сырого газа на месторождениях для оперативных точных подсчетов количества добытого и закачанного в пласты сырья. Кроме того , начато изучение и оценка потенциала разработки метана угольных пластов. Увеличение газоперерабатывающих мощностей. Учитывая наличие доказанных ресурсов газа, необходимо наличие достаточных мощностей для их переработки. В стране наблюдается нехватка газоперерабатывающих заводов для переработки необходимых объемов, кроме того, технологические решения некоторых имеющихся мощностей не соответствуют спецификациям поставляемого газа (например ГПЗ на Чинаревском месторождении) . Основной эффект планируют получить за счет снижения обратной закачки газа на Кашагане т.к. по информации Минэнерго РК в условиях Кашагана закачка газа в пласт не дает такого же эффекта, как на Тенгизе и Карачаганаке . В 2025 г . будет введен в эксплуатацию ГПЗ на Кашагане мощностью 1 млрд м3, в 2029 г . – второй 15 для проектов, заключенных после 1 января 2023 г . или увеличивающих объемы добычи газа на действующих месторождениях Обзор газовой отрасли РК 17 ГПЗ мощностью 4 млрд м3. Кроме того, приняты решения о строительстве ГПЗ мощностью 4 млрд м3 на Карачаганакском месторождении и ГПЗ мощностью 900 млн м3 в городе Жанаозен. Все перечисленные меры нашли отражение в принятом Правительством РК Комплексном плане развития газовой отрасли на 2022 -2026 гг. (утвержден 18 июля 2022 г., ПП РК №488) в целях принятия экстренных мер для увеличения объемов товарного газа и реформирования газовой отрасли страны. Популяризаци я культуры бережливо го потребления природного газа . Основной посыл в широкие массы должен постоянно направляться для популяризации понимани я населением факта ограниченности ресурсов газа в стране и необходимости его бережного потребления. Казахстан не является газовой державой , ресурсная база ограничена, страна импортирует газ из соседних регионов для покрытия внутреннего спроса, что ставит под угрозу энергетическую безопасность страны . Для этих целей в 2023 г. был разработан и утвержден16 План энергоэффективности и бережного потребления газа на 2023 -2025 гг. Среди ключевых мероприятий, которые усилят дисциплину потребления газа как со стороны населения, так и промышленных потребителей и ТЭК , можно выделить: • контроль за потреблением – переход к «рациональному и бережливому потреблению газа»; • Реализация комплекса мер по энергоэффективности – введение нормативного потребления с дифференцированным тарифом на газ, оптимизация норматива температуры в отопительный сезон по примеру Европейского союза, переход на резервное топливо (уголь); • оптимизация потерь на газотранспортной системе; • создание единой системы учета газа (цифровизация газотранспортных и газораспределительных систем с учетом международной практики); • повышение эффективности топливно -энергетического комплекса (ТЭК); • установление норм потребления товарного газа для населения отдельно для каждого региона с учетом климатических условий; • внедрение искусственного интеллекта по определению потребления газа населением. Первый этап внедрения запланирован на 2024 г ., второй – до января 2025 г. По нашему мнению, текущие прогнозы Правительства по наращиванию собственных ресурсов товарного газа являются оптимистичными. По плану уже с 2026 г . будут получены 5.5"}

Возникают сомнения , за счет каких ресурсов будет достигнуто такое значительное увеличение. Процесс ввода новых мощностей, от планирования, ГРР до стадии разработки, требует , при благоприятном исходе, в среднем 7 -10 лет, потенциал уже имеющихся месторождений огра ничен. Кроме того, в целом ввод новых месторождений требует колоссальных инвестиций. Предпринимаемые меры по стимулированию буд ут иметь временной лаг до момента входа новых инвесторов. Поэтому мы считаем, что наращивание объемов производства товарного газа для недопущения дефицита в краткосрочной перспективе вероятнее обеспечить за счет тройки мега проектов, чем от ввода в эксплуатацию потенциально новых активов АО НК «КазМунайГаз» и АО «НК «QazaqGaz». При этом, учитывая, что вероятность снижения объемов обр атной закачки газа на Тенгиз, Карачаганак весьма мала (технология является апробированной, снижение закачки приведет к снижению добычи нефти, выгода от реализации дополнительного объема товарного газа не покрывает значительные экономические потери, связанн ые со снижением объемов добычи нефти), поставки на внутренний рынок могут быть увеличены за счет перенаправления части экспортных объемов. Для этого необходимо предоставить привлекательную закупочную цену на дополнительные объемы газа. 16 Постановление Правительства Республики Казахстан от 19 октября 2023 года № 924 Обзор газовой отрасли РК 18 Проблемы газовой отрасли В Казахстане сосредоточено 1.2% общемировых запасов газа, ежегодно страна наращивает объемы добычи природного газа, однако на газовом рынке Казахстана присутствует ряд ограничивающих факторов. Возникший дефицит газа на внутреннем рынке вызван не физическим отсутствием газа, проблема заключается в структуре газового рынка и строгих ограничениях цены на реализацию газа для потребителей. Внутренняя переработка газа нерентабельна ввиду жесткого тари фного режима, газоперерабатывающих мощностей не хватает для удо влетворения растущего внутреннего спроса. В стране есть потенциал значительно нарастить доступные ресурсы сырого газа и выпуск товарного газа, однако для этого требуется значительный объем инвестиций в геологоразведку и разработку месторождений, строительство дополнительных газоперерабатывающих мо щностей, принят ие мер по увеличению экономической привлекательности и рентабельности инвестиций в реализацию газовых проектов. Нефтегазовый комплекс является капиталоемкой отраслью, которая требует значительных инвестиций как в секторе разведки и добычи, так и переработки. Нефтегазовые проекты имеют длительные сроки реализации, окупаемости и высокую степень риска. В этой связи важ но определить наиболее выгодные источники финансирования проектов и их рациональное сочетание. Учитывая нехватку товарных объемов газа на внутреннем рынке страны, попутный газ стал востребованным ресурсом. На наш взгляд , потребуется много времени для принятия комплекса стимулирующих мер для того, чтобы заинтересовать недропользователей снижать закачку газа. Разные оценки показывают экономическую нецелесообразность – доходы от реализации газа не покрывают убытки от снижения добычи и реализации нефти даже с учетом принятых в последние годы изменений и мер . Кроме того, по условиям СРП операторы Тенгиз, Кашаган, Карачаганак имеют право закачивать обратно в пласт от 40% попутного газа для поддержания уровня добычи нефти. Это условия соглашения, на которые очень трудно повлиять как минимум до окончания срока СРП. Кроме того, в соглашениях нет обязательства обеспечить энергобезопасность Казахстана, что также необходимо принять во внимание при выработке позиции страны к моменту окончания срока СРП. На сегодня Кашаган , Карачаганак, Тенгиз чисто коммерческие проекты. На наш взгляд , быстро и полностью покрыть дефицит за счет новых проектов не получится ввиду высокой капитало - и трудо емкости геологоразведки , а также длительности процесса. Кроме того, всегда присутствуют риски недостижения и неоправданности усилий и затрат. Потенциал уже открытых и наиболее подготовленных проектов по добыче газа ограничен. В этой связи недостающие объемы газа в ближайшей перспективе будут покрываться за счет импорта, наиболее вероятно из России. В этой ситуации возникает вопрос по цене поставок, и учитывая ситуацию в Украин е, санкционный режим, необходимость сбыта избыточных объемов российского газа, важность транспортных коридоров Казахстана на пути в Азию, необходимы переговоры по цене на взаимовыгодных условиях. При этом чрезмерная зависимость от импортных ресурсов для реализации стратегически важных проектов в будущем поставит под вопрос возможност ь их независимой и бесперебойной эксплуа тации. Необходимо продолжить работу по установлению справедливых тарифов и цен, стимулирующих развитие газовой отрасли. При этом, учитывая разный уровень себестоимости добычи у недропользователей, подход должен быть дифференцированным. С учетом сложившейся ситуации, важна дальнейшая работа и популяризация в широких массах принципов рационально го и эффективно го потреблени я товарного газа. Также следует рассмотреть возможность покупки долей в запасах газа других организаций, частных нефтегазодобывающих компаний, создания совместных предприятий , которые разрабатывают нефтегазовые месторождения, что также позволит в короткие сроки увеличить объем производства природного газа.

Завершены полевые сейсморазведочные работы и обработка, интерпретация на участках Северный Озен, Жаркын и Березовский. Планируется получение контрактов и привлечение стратегических партнёров. В 2024 году начато бурение разведочной скважины Тургай Палеозой глубиной 5 500 метров в Кызылординской области. Также в 2024 году по участку Каратон Подсолевой начато бурение первой поисковой скважины глубиной 5 500 метров, окончание испытаний планируется в 2025 году. На месторождении Рожковское в Западно- Казахстанской области к промышленной эксплуатации подключено 5 скважин, что позволило достичь суточной добычи сырого газа в размере 1,4 млн м 3/сутки. В настоящее время партнерами проекта совместно с ТОО «Урал Ойл энд Газ» проводится работа для обеспечения увеличения фонда эксплуатируемых скважин, объема добычи, повышение эффективности разработки месторождения. На месторождении «Урихтау» в 2024 году введена в эксплуатацию скважина ВУ-6, которая позволила получить прирост дебита нефти на уровне 90,3 т/сутки. Продолжаются работы по бурению эксплуатационных скважин ВУ-7,8 с планируемым вводом в эксплуатацию в 2025 году. Продолжаются проектные работы для определения концепции дальнейшего развития месторождения. В 2024 году объем добычи нефти и газового конденсата КМГ составил 23 837 тыс. тонн (490 тыс. барр. в сутки), увеличившись на 1,3%. Объем добычи попутного и природного газа (до объемов обратной закачки) увеличился на 1,0% до 9 554 млн м 3. КМГ активно развивает международное сотрудничество. Так, в 2024 году КМГ подписал соглашение в области геологоразведки с CNOOC по новому проекту недропользования Жылыой, а также соглашение о совместных исследованиях с компаниями Shell и Chevron с целью изучения геолого-геофизических данных по проекту Мугоджар. Одним из приоритетов КМГ является модернизация производственных мощностей. В рамках наращивания перерабатывающих мощностей реализуется проект по увеличению производительности Шымкентского НПЗ до 12 млн тонн в год к 2030 году.

В 2024 году завершена разработка технико-экономических обоснований по вышеуказанным проектам, осуществлена их загрузка на портал РГП «Госэкспертиза» с целью прохождения комплексной вневедомственной экспертизы. . Продолжается реализация проектов: газификация северо-восточных регионов Казахстана, капитальный ремонт МГ «Средняя Азия – Центр», строительство 2-й нитки МГ «Бейнеу – Бозой – Шымкент», МГ «Актобе – Костанай» и компрессорной станции КС-14.Продолжается работа по реализации важных инфраструктурных проектов в газовой отрасли: газификации северо-восточных регионов Казахстана, капитальному ремонту магистрального газопровода «Средняя Азия – Центр», строительству 2-й нитки магистрального газопровода «Бейнеу – Бозой – Шымкент», магистрального газопровода «Актобе – Костанай» и компрессорной станции КС-14. Следует отметить, что по-прежнему актуальной остается проблема убыточности тарифа на поставку природного газа казахстанским потребителям. Объемы убытков QazaqGaz в 2024 году составили 178,5 млрд тенге в связи с недостаточным повышением оптовых цен в среднем по Казахстану (на 14,6%). СЖИЖЕННЫЙ НЕФТЯНОЙ ГАЗ По итогам переговоров между партнёрами Северо-Каспийского проекта и QazaqGaz, при участии Министерства энергетики РК и ТОО «PSA», стороны достигли соглашения по условиям сделки купли-продажи Кашаганского сжиженного нефтяного газа. Данный шаг был обусловлен его высоким спросом в периметре внутреннего рынка Казахстана. Подписание договора стало важным этапом в рамках сотрудничества, направленного на принятие окончательного инвестиционного решения по проекту. Согласно условиям соглашения, поставка Кашаганского сжиженного нефтяного газа планируется на конец 2025 года, с выходом на максимальную проектную мощность в объеме более 700 тысяч тонн в год к 2027 году после завершения инфраструктурных работ. В настоящее время QazaqGaz ведет работы по проектированию и размещению заказов на необходимое технологическое оборудование для обеспечения приема, хранения, перевалки и фракционирования Кашаганского сжиженного нефтяного газа. Эти поставки благоприятно повлияют на социально-экономическое положение регионов Казахстана, помогут сократить дефицит сжиженного нефтяного газа и способствовать развитию газохимической отрасли в стране. АО «Самрук-Қазына» Годовой отчет 2024 45 44 РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ ДЕЯТЕЛЬНОСТИ ФОНДА QazaqGaz целенаправленно проводит работу по укреплению транзитного потенциала. В частности, разработан и утвержден совместный План мероприятий по организации работ по подготовке магистрального газопровода «Средняя Азия – Центр» (далее – МГ «САЦ») к транспорту российского газа в Республику Узбекистан, включающий в себя 2 этапа сотрудничества: Этап 1. Комбинированный выделенный маршрут МГ «САЦ-4»/МГ «САЦ-5». Выполнение всех мероприятий в рамках данного УКРЕПЛЕНИЕ ТРАНЗИТНОГО ПОТЕНЦИАЛА этапа своевременно завершены, транзит российского газа начался с 1 октября 2023 года. Отмечается динамика по увеличению объемов транзита газа. Если в 2023 году объем транзита составил 1,3 млрд м 3, то, по итогам 2024 года данный показатель достиг 5,6 млрд м 3. Планируемый объем транзита газа на 2025 год – 5,5 млрд м3. В рамках реализации Этапа 2 по выделенному маршруту МГ «САЦ-4» планируется увеличение транзита до 11 млрд м 3 /год. В целях обеспечения необходимого объема транспортировки российского трубопроводного газа в 2024 году начаты ремонтные работы, которые продлятся вплоть до конца 2026 года. Транзитная транспортировка российского газа по направлениям в Узбекистан и Кыргызстан осуществлялась в согласованных объемах. В рамках развития инициативы по взаимовыгодному сотрудничеству по данному направлению реализованы следующие задачи: между АО «НК «QazaqGaz» и ООО «Газпром экспорт» заключены 2 контракта на поставку российского газа в Казахстан в целях реализации договоренностей, закрепленных в Протоколе между Правительством РК и ПАО «Газпром» по вопросам сотрудничества в газовой отрасли в 2023-2024 годах; 27 декабря 2024 года между АО «НК «QazaqGaz» и ООО «Газпром экспорт» подписан контракт на поставку российского газа в РК на 2025-2026 гг. в рамках Соглашения между Правительством РК и ПАО «Газпром». Достигнуты следующие ключевые результаты за 2024 год: Увеличено годовое контрактное количество за первый год поставки до 5,5-6,2 млрд м 3 в рамках договора купли-продажи природного газа с компанией «PetroChina International Alashankou Company Limited» (2023–2026гг.). Наращены поставки газа на экспорт в летний период, что позволяет увеличить выручку от экспортных операций по группе QazaqGaz. Снижены скидки за недопоставку и ухудшение качества газа при экспортных поставках.РЕАЛИЗАЦИЯ ГАЗА НА ЭКСПОРТ И ВНУТРЕННИЙ РЫНОКЭкспортные поставки осуществлены в согласованных объемах без ущерба для внутреннего рынка. Организованы поставки российского газа для увеличения экспортного потенциала в Китай.Предусмотрены компенсирующие поставки при внеплановых ремонтных работах на Оренбургском ГПЗ. Важно отметить, что QazaqGaz сохраняет объемы экспорта газа на международные рынки без ущерба внутреннему рынку. За последние годы QazaqGaz успешно реализовал ряд крупных проектов в области устойчивого развития. На протяжении двух лет Компания следует лучшим международным практикам, формируя и публикуя отчетность по стандарту GRI (Global Reporting Initiative). Так, по итогам 2024 года, в рамках имплементации комплексной Стратегии развития QazaqGaz до 2032 года Компания присоединилась к Глобальному договору ООН. Кроме того, в 2024 году QazaqGaz вступил в Национальную Конфедерацию работодателей (предпринимателей) Республики Казахстан «PARYZ». Все это свидетельствует о приверженности компании ESG-принципам и социальной ответственности бизнеса. В результате QazaqGaz повысил позицию в ESG-рейтинге с 19,2 до 18,2 по версии Morn - ingStar Sustainalytics. Не менее значимым достижением является получение высокой оценки от ключевого рейтингового агентства MSCI на уровне АА. По итогам раскрытия информации за 2024 год, в рамках Климатической программы CDP, QazaqGaz улучшил свои показатели в климатическом рейтинге, подняв позицию на три пункта до уровня «B». В рамках Стратегии развития QazaqGaz запланирована работа по следующим направлениям: реализация мероприятий, предусмотренных актуализированным Комплексным планом развития газовой отрасли РК, включая работу по увеличению ресурсной базы товарного газа, развитию внутреннего рынка газа, развитию транзита и экспорта газа, газохимии и глубокой переработки, инвестиционной и операционной эффективности; реализация проекта по строительству ГПЗ на м.

Kazak hstan Energy Profile Country overview The Republic of Kazakhstan (Kazakhstan) lies in northern Central Asia and is bordered by the Russian Federation (Russia) to the north, China to the east, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan to the south, and the Caspian Sea and Turkmenistan to the west. Kazakhstan’s land area is 2 717 300 square kilometres ( km2) with almost 1 894 km of coastline on the Caspian Sea. The capital is Nur-Sultan (previously called Astana) and the country is home to 18.7 million people (www.stat.gov.kz ). Until 2015, Kazakhstan was among the world’s top ten fastest -growing economies, mainly owing to development of its rich oil, gas and coal resources and its export -oriented policies. The country is the largest oil producer in Central Asia, with the 12th -highest proven crude oil reserves in the world. Its gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita has risen six -fold since 2002 (https://www.wor ldbank.org/en/country/kazakhstan/overview#3 ), and i n 2019 its real GDP grew 4. 5% as a result of higher consumer spending and mining -related investment s (https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/kazakhstan/overview#3 ). Due to the global COVID -19 pandemic, however, Kazakhstan’s GDP could contract 3% in 2020 according to World Bank estimates ( https://www.worldbank .org/en/country/kazakhstan/overview#3 ). Kazakhstan produced 91.9 million tonnes (Mt) of crude oil in 2018 (including gas condensate) with increased production at its Kashagan field (https:// www.kazenergy.com/upload/document/energy -report/NationalReport19_en.pdf ). Kashagan , the fifth -largest reserve in the world, is expected to play a major role in Kazakhstan's future oil production , with projected production of 450 thousand barrels per day (k b/d) by 2025 and 955 kb/d by 2040. Progress has been achieved in Kazakhstan’s gas network development : in 2016 three lines of the transnational Turkmenistan- Uzbekistan- Kazakhstan -China gas pipeline were completed, increas ing transit gas volumes from 30 billion cubic metres per year (bcm /y) to 55 bcm/y, and the Beineu-Bozo i-Shymkent pipeline connecting the western producing region with the densely populated south also became operatio nal in 2016 (http://energo.gov.kz/index.php?id=49 ). Kazakhstan Country overview Country overview PAGE | 3 IEA. All rights reserved. Key energy data Supply  Kazakhstan is a major producer of all fossil fuels (coal, crude oil and natural gas).  In 2018 , Kazakhstan was the world’s 9th-largest coal producer ( 108 million tonnes [Mt] ). It ranked 1 7th in the world for crude oil production ( 91.9 Mt ), and 24th for natural gas ( 38.7 bcm ).  It is the first energy producer among EU4Energy focus countries (1 6th in the world in 2018 ). It produces more than twice as much crude oil as Azerbaijan but around half the natural gas produced in Turkmenistan.  Kazakhstan ’s total energy production ( 178 million tonnes of oil equivalent [Mtoe] in 2018) covers more than twice its energy demand. Exports  Kazakhstan is also a major energy exporter. In 2018 , it was the world ’s 9th- largest exporter of coal, 9 th of crude oil and 12th of natural gas. Demand  In 2018, Kazakhstan ’s energy consumption (measured by total primary energy supply) was 76 Mtoe, comparable to consumption in the Netherlands (73 Mtoe) . Among EU4Energy focus countries, Kazakhstan is the second- largest energy consumer after Ukraine.  Coal represents around half of Kazakhstan’s energy mix ( 50% in 2018), followed by oil and natural gas ( both with 25% shares) .  Coal is mostly transformed into electricity and heat before reaching the final consumer. Coal fuels around 70% of electricity generation (in 201 8), followed by natural gas ( 20% in 2018).  Total final consumption ( TFC; e xcluding transformation processes) amounts to around 40 Mtoe (42 Mtoe in 2018).  Industry is the primary final energy consum er (16 Mtoe in 2018 ), followed by the residential sector ( 11 Mtoe).  Oil and coal together form over 50% of the final consumption. Share of natural gas i s relatively low (13% share of TFC in 2018) . Kazakhstan Country overview Country overview PAGE | 4 IEA. All rights reserved. Renewables Renewable energy accounted for only 1.4% of the energy mix (TPES) in 2018 . Share in electricity generation was 10.4% in 2018, of which most is hydro electricity.

It is current ly implement ing two presidential program mes: 100 Concrete Steps and Strategy Kazakhstan 2050. The Mazhilis does not typically play a policymaking role, but reviews policies develop ed and proposed by the government and enacts laws accordingly. In early 2017, the President of Kazakhstan decided to transfer some presidential power (in regulati ng social and economic processes) to the parliament and the g overnment. This transfer of powe r is only at a technical level, however: the president retains the status of supreme arbiter capable of regulating relationships among the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government, and of address ing issues of national security and the country’s defence capabilit ies (http://khabar.kz/ru/arkhiv -zheti -kn/item/73940- zheti -kn-29- yanvarya -2017 ). Judiciary In Kazakhstan, there are a supreme court, local (r egional, city and district) courts and speciali sed (military, juvenile and economic) courts; o ther speciali sed courts may also be created. The supreme court – the highest judicial body on civil, criminal, economic and other cases under the jurisdiction of the lower courts – exercises procedural forms of judicial supervision over their activities and provides explanations on issues of judicial practice. In 2016, Kazakhstan's justice system was converted to a three -tier system (first, appeal and cassation) and the new Code of Civil Procedure entered into force. To improve its attractiveness for foreign investors , Kazakhstan plans to generali se the judicial practice of investment disputes. In matters of administrative and criminal humani sation of legislation , it plans to apply penalties and reasonable deadlines for their payment (http://www.kazpravda .kz/articles/view/sudebnaya- sistema --vazhnoe- zveno- uspeshnoi -realizatsii - poslaniya1/ ).

The Committee for Regulation of Natural Monopolies and Protection o f Competition is the state body for protection of competition and restriction of monopolistic activities on the relevant commodities markets ; for control and regulation of activities related to state monopoly within the limits provided by legislation ; and for cross -sector co -ordination, regulation and control of natural monopolies and regulated markets. It is responsible for control ling and regulati ng the activities of energy -producing and energy -providing organi sations in accordance with the Law o n Electri c Energy (http://www.kremzk.gov.kz/eng/ ). Key policies In 2012 , the government launched the Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy defining the course for long -term economic development. It identifies social, economic and political reforms aim ed at placing Kazakhstan among the top 30 global economies by 2050. Economic growth is to be achieved by reaching new export markets, improving the investment climate and further developing the private sector and public -private partner ships. The strategy stipulates that alternative and “green ” energy technologies must generate up to 50% of all consumed energy by 2050. It also declares that all mining companies should transition to environmentally friendly production only. In May 2013, the Green Economy Concept was adopted, setting the ambitious target of 50% electricity generation from sources other than coal or oil, including gas, nuclear and renewable energy , by 2050. The government plans to achieve this by phasing out ageing infrastr ucture, increasing the use of these alternative fuels, installing efficient energy technologies and complying with high ecological standards.

Steps include privatising agricultural lands to encourage their eff icient use; optimi sing tax and custom s policies and procedures; introduc ing a “single window ” principle for customs procedures for exporters and importers; integrati ng customs and tax systems; simplif ying the legalisation procedure for property and money ; privatising state -monopol ised examination of pre- design and design documents ; and replacing outdated construction standards and rules with the eurocodes system . As part of the programme, the Astana I nternational Financial Centre (AIFC) was opened in 2018 and one of its tools for attracting investors is investment residency. The government has also introduced reforms to support a favourable investment climate : rules for establishing a one- stop shop for investors were adopted in February 2015, and the Law on Investments was amended in December 2 014, supported by a liberalised visa regime. Energy statistics Official energy statistics in Kazakhstan are the responsibility of the Committee on Statistics under the Ministry of National Economy. In 2016, the energy data collection system was modified as part of moderni sation efforts by the Committee on Statistics. In 2018 the Committee o n Statistics conducted a household fuel and energy consumption survey, covering 21 000 households. This was Kazakhstan’s first-ever household survey to specifically focus on energy consumption. The survey included various questions on fuel consumption for heating, cooking, water heating, etc. , and the results are available on the Committee on Statistics website. The main energy publication is the annual Fuel and E nergy Balance of the Republic of Kazakhstan . It contains annual data on energy supply and demand in physical and energy units with sectoral breakdowns, as well as energy intensity indicators. The publication is available online in electronic format , and t he layout follows th at developed under the Soviet Union. Official annual data is shared with the United Nations Statistics Division ( UNSD) and the Inte rnational Energy Agency (IEA) through five joint IEA/Eurostat/UNECE questionnaires. Monthly oil and gas data are also collected Kazakhstan Country overview Country overview PAGE | 8 IEA. All rights reserved. and transmitted to the UNSD for publication through the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI) , as well as to the Interstate Statistical Committee of the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS). The Committee on Statistics maintains an national energy statistics working group, bringing together data providers and data users (energy companies, researchers and ministry representatives) to improve the quality and use of energy data. Official energy statistics are actively used for electricity sector modelling by the Kazakh Research Institute of Power Engineering. R egional energy intens ity indicators are used in regional development policy. The Committee on Statistics has done major work in recent years on consolidati ng energy statistics, with some technical and financial support from the internationally funded Kazstat and INOGATE program mes. There are also plans to publish the energy balance in International Reco mmendations for Energy Statistics (IRES) format , in addition to the standard format , to increase both domestic and international use of national energy data. Kazakhstan Chapter 1. Energy security Country overview PAGE | 9 IEA. All rights reserved. Chapter 1 . Energy security Resource endowment At the end of 2018, Kazakhstan’s proved oil reserves were 3 900 Mt and the reserves -to-production (R/P) ratio was 42. 7 (https://www.bp.com/ content/dam/bp/business -sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy -economics/ statistical -review/bp- stats -review-2019- full-report.pdf ); this amounts to 1.7% of the world’s total liquid reserves and puts Kazakhstan in 12th place worldwide (https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business -sites/en/global/ corporate/pdfs/energy -economics/statistical -review/bp- stats -review -2019- full- report.pdf ). Kazakhstan is also rich in natural gas deposits , with 1 000 bcm of proved reserves at the end of 2018 (0.5% of total world reserves ) at an R/P ratio of 40.7, and p roven reserves of coal totalled 25 605 Mt (2.4% of total world reserves) at an R/P ratio of 217 (https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business -sites/en/ global/corporate/pdfs/energy -economics/statistical -review/bp- stats -review -2019- full-report.pdf ). There are 271 oil and 61 gas condensate fields in Kazakhstan. More than 90% of oil reserves are c oncentrated in 15 major fields , and about 70% of the countr y’s proved and probable (2P) oil and gas condensate reserves are found in the five largest fields (Tengiz, Kashagan, Korolevskoye, Karachaganak and Zhanazhol). Approximately 98% of Kazakhstan's natural gas reserves are located in the west, with 85% concentrated in just a few large fields (Tengiz, Kashagan, Karachaganak, Zhanazhol and Imashevskoye). Energy security and diversification Highly reliant on its significant fossil fuel resources , Kazakhstan is a net exporter of energy and energy products. Howev er, some residents – in northern and central Kazakhstan – still do not have access to network gas because n atural gas reserves are in the west ern part of the country , population centres are in the north, east and south, and the domestic pipeline system is underdeveloped. Kazakhstan Chapter 1. Energy security Country overview PAGE | 10 IEA. All rights reserved. Kazakhstan therefore relies on gas imports from Russia and Uzbekistan to meet domestic demand : a gas-swap ping arrangement between Kazakhstan and Russia entails the replacement of Karachaganak gas, which has historically been supplied to Orenburg for processing, with imports of Central Asian gas to the southern part of Kazakhstan and Russian gas to the Kostanay region (https://www.kmgep.kz/eng/investor_relations/annual _reports/ ). Activities are, however, under way to expand networks to increase overall access to gas . Following an order of the former president in 2018, construction of the Saryarka gas pipeline was begun to provide gas to the capital city of Nur- Sultan as well as central and northern Kazakhstan by 2023. Pipeline construction began in November 2018 , and in October 2019 the first stage from Kyzylorda to Nur -Sultan was completed ( https://ru.sputniknews.kz /economy/20191129/12161758/Vtoraya- ochered- gazoprovoda- Saryarka- otsenivaetsya- v-124-milliona -dollarov.html ). The pipeline’s capacity will be 2.2 b cm of gas per year , and"}

These measures should improve the air quality of Nur -Sultan, as coal c onsumption is expected to decrease by 650 kt per year ( https://inbusiness.kz/ru/last/stalo- izvestno- v-kakie -rajony -stolicy -v-pervuyu -ochered- provedut -gaz). In April 2020 , installa tion of the main gas pipeline was being completed at Nur-Sultan (https://informburo.kz/novosti/v -nur-sultane -montazh- magistr alnogo- gazoprovoda- nahoditsya- na-stadii -zaversheniya.html ). Strong economic growth and a rising standard of living are expected to boost energy demand considerably in upcoming years. To meet this rising demand in a reliable, affordable and sustainable manner , the government plans to expand generation capacity from various fuel sources through new investment s and modernisation of existing capacity. However , construction of a 2 640-megawatt ( MW) coal-fired power plant at Balkhash Lake was suspended in 2016 because the Ministry of Energy decided that moderni sation of power plants to date , the creation of substantial reserves and a decline in energy consumption growth render this plant unnecessary before 2022 ( http://ratel.kz/kaz/v_kazahstane_ne_budet_elektrostantsii_samsung ). According to Kazenergy ’s 2015 report , the availability of low -cost coal means the established fleet of large coal -fired power plants will continue to dominat e until 2040, although gas -fired generation will also increase as Kazakhstan’s gas network expands. Kazenergy expects only modest growth in renewable energy production due to its intermittent nature and the technical and economic issues of integrating renewables into Kazakhstan’s unified energy system , unless there are significant Kazakhstan Chapter 1. Energy security Country overview PAGE | 11 IEA. All rights reserved. changes in technical reliability in either renewables production (wind and solar in particular) or in grid operations (http://kazenergy.com/images/National Report15_English.pdf ). Low liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) prices have raised demand for the product . The LPG market is regulated, with the government set ting a price limit on LPG every quarter , but there has been a deficit of LPG in the domestic market due to illegal exports to neighbou ring countries where the price is much higher. Because l ow maximum wholesale prices and increased consumption in the domestic market have led to losses and deteriorati ng financial and economic conditions for the owners and producers of LPG , the Ministry of E nergy had planned to phas e out state regulation of wholesale prices (http://energo.gov.kz/index.php?id=49 ), but in 2019 regulation was still in place with the Minister of Energy approv ing a maximum LPG price (https://www.zakon.kz/4986539- predelnye- tseny -na-szhizhennyy -gaz.html ). Moderni sation of the three refiner ies, completed in 2018, has helped reduce the need to import light crude oil products . Refinery t hroughput increased 10% in 2018 to 16.4 Mt, providing 93% of the domestic market’s gasoline supplies, 91% of its diesel and 62% of its jet kerosene (https://www.kazenergy.com /upload/document/energy -report/NationalReport 19_en.pdf ). New refinery capacities are expected to completely meet domes tic needs by 2030. Energy co -operation between Kazakhstan and China is based mainly on China ’s need to import energy for development and to diversify its import sources, and on Kazakhstan’s aim to diversity its export routes and expand export volumes . China is a key strategic energy sector partner, with Chinese companies involved in Kazakhstan’s energy development, mainly hydrocarbons, including upstream development and pipeline construction as well as domestic oil refining and gas processing. China’s equit y shares in Kazakhstan’s oil production have increased rapidly, reaching 25% in 2009 , and the 2013 v isit of Chinese President Xi Jinping led to the signing of energy deals worth USD 30 billion, including the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) acquisition of an 8.3 % stake in Kashagan, the largest oilfield in the world outside the Middle East ( http://astanatimes.com/2014/01/energy -cooperation- kazakhstan -china/ ).With completion of the Beyneu- Bozoy- Shymkent natural gas pipeline in 2015 (capacity of 15 bcm per year), exports to China increased to 5.2 bcm in 2018. ( https://www.ka zenergy.com/upload/document/energy - report/NationalReport19_en.pdf ). Kazakhstan Chapter 1. Energy security Country overview PAGE | 12 IEA. All rights reserved. The treaty establishing the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) came into force on 1 January 2015, the m ember states being Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia. (http://www.eurasiancommission.org/en/ Pages/default.aspx ). The core objective was the free movement of goods, capital, services and people within the single market. Although t he E AEU eliminated customs duties on trade among its member states, it excluded most energy commodities from its general trade rules. Rather, energy trade among Customs Union members is governed largely by special bilateral trade agreements (http://kazenergy.com/images/NationalReport15_English.pdf ). According to the EAEU treaty , a common electric ity market was to be operational by 1 July 2019, while the common markets for gas, oil and petroleum products are to be in place by 1 January 2025. ( http://www.eurasiancommission.org/en/nae/news/Pages/17- 11-2015- 15.aspx ). In May 2019, heads of EAEU countries signed an agreement on a common electricity market . It is expected to begin functioning when the rules on common trade enter into force ( https://ria.ru/20190530/1555095463.html ). Oil product tariffs (except for A -80 and LPG ) have been freed from direct state regulation: in December 2014 gasoline grades A -80, A -92 and A-93 as well as diesel and LPG were regulated , while in September 2015 state regulation was lifted for gasolines A -92 and A -93 and in July 2016 diesel was also excluded. The government will continue to administratively influence the prices of certain types of refined products (A -80 and LPG) until refinery moderni sation is complete ( http://www.kazenergy.com/upload/document/energy -report/ National_Energy_Report -ENGLISH_03.09.pdf ). Kazakhstan’s r etail prices for oil products continue to be among the lowest in the world (https://inbusiness.kz/ru/news/toplivo- v-kazahstane- ostaetsya- odnim -iz- deshevyh -v-mire). Even though administrative price reduction was phased out during 2014 -16, Kazenergy (2019) reports that the Committee for the Regulation of Natural Monopolies, Protection of Competition and Consumer Rights often fines retail stations for “anti -competitive” pricing practices and thereby keeps retail prices low (https://www.kazenergy.com/upload/document/energy"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_KazakhstanEnergyProfile_4", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\KazakhstanEnergyProfile.pdf", "text": "- report/NationalReport19_en.pdf ). Since April 2020, large gas stations in Kazakhstan have reduced their retail gasoline and diesel fuel prices as a result of government support measures , even though such administrative price reductions will affect the ir profitability all the way from production to retail (https://inbusiness.kz/ru/news/toplivo- v-kazahstane- ostaetsya- odnim -iz-deshevyh -v- mire). Kazakhstan Chapter 1. Energy security Country overview PAGE | 13 IEA. All rights reserved. Energy i nfrastructure and investment Electricity The Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating Company ( KEGOC ) reported that total installed capacity in Kazakhstan was 21.9 gigawatts ( GW) on 1 January 2019 , of which 18.9 GW was available capacity (https://www. kegoc.kz/ru/elektroenergetika/elektroenergetika- kazahstana- klyuchevye -fakty). Disaggregated data on the installed capacity of power plants by type are not availabl e from official sources. Coal -fired plants account for 70.4 % of power generation, most ly located in central, northern and eastern Kazakhstan. The 76 power plants connected to Kazakhstan’s unified energy system are grouped into three general categories for purposes of dispatch and operation: plants of national significance, plants of regional significance, and industr y-owned facilities . During the “tariﬀ for investment” period , electricity investments rose (especially in 2009- 15). Nevertheless, in 2017 depreciation rate for nearly 36% of turbine equipment at existing thermal power plants was still over 75% (https://www.kazenergy.com/upload/document/energy -report/NationalReport 19_en.pdf ). Heat is produced by 40 co-generation plants (45% of total heat energy production) , 28 large boiler s (35% of production) and 886 small boiler s of less than 100 gigacalories per hour ( Gcal/h) (20% of production ) (http://kazenergy.com/images/NationalReport15_English.pdf ). The heating network is 11 500 km long and transmission losses are 30%. Kazakhstan maintains over 71 600 km of high -voltage transmission lines, mainly of 110 kilovolts ( kV) and 220 kV. Of this total, KEGOC owns and operates 25 097 km of 0.4 -kV to 1 150-kV high -voltage lines and 78 electr ic power substations with instal led transmission capacity of 36 660 megavolt -amperes (MVA )(https://www.kegoc.kz/en/shareholders -and-investors/infor mation- disclosure/annual -reports/2018 ). KEGOC constructed more than 1 700 km of lines and three new 500-kV substations between 2014 and 2018 : Semey, Aktogay and Taldykorgan. In 2018 , KEGOC commissioned the high-voltage 500-kV Shulbinskaya hydropower plant ( HPP) Semey -Aktogai-Taldykorgan- Alma transmission line, which is the final stage of North- East-South 500- kV Electricity Transmission Construction Project (https: //www.kegoc.kz/en/shareholders -and-investors/information- disclosure/ annual -reports/2018 ). Kazakhstan Chapter 1. Energy security Country overview PAGE | 14 IEA. All rights reserved. Kazakhstan has three main oil refineries as well as a number of mini plants with total annual capacity of 18.3 Mt. In 2018, modernisation of three major refiner ies was accomplished at a cost of USD 6 billion , reduc ing Kazakhstan’s dependency on oil product import s from Russia. Oil refining amounted to 16. 4 Mt in 2018, a 1.5-Mt increase from 2017. Since being modernis ed, Kazakhstan’s refineries can produce K -4 and K -5 fuels (corresponding to the Euro 4 and Euro 5 grades ) (https://www.kazenergy.com/upload/document/energy -report/National Report19_en.pdf ). Kashagan is one of the ten largest oilfields discovered in the world in recent years , at a cost of US D 50 billion ; the f irst oil was extracted in September 2013 , but after one month it was shut down due to pipeline leaks resulting from sulphide stress cracking. In January 2017, production at Kashagan field reached 180 000 barrel s per day (b/d) following resumption of production in October 2016. Production capacity of Kashagan Phase 1 was expected to reach 370 000 b/d (http://oilprice.com/latest -energy -news/world- news/kashagan - production- ramping- up-to-180000- bpd.html ). Kashagan’s output was 8.3 Mt in 2017 and 13.2 Mt in 2018, and daily production , which was var iable because operations were suspen ded during part of April and May due to maintenance and repairs , reached 375 000 b/d in July . Kazenergy (2019) has report ed that Kashagan could reach its maximum output of 45 Mt in 2040 (955 000 b/d). (https://www.kazenergy.com/upload/document/energy - report/NationalReport19_en.pdf ). To facilitate oil exports to China, Kazakhstan launched the first stage of its cross- border oil export pipeline to China, the 962 -km, 10-Mt/y Atasu -Alashankou pipeline, in December 2005. At a cost of USD 700 million , the pipeline was built as a 50- 50 joint venture between the national Kazmunaygas (KMG ) company’s subsidiary KazTransOil (KTO) and CNPC subsidiary China National Corporation for Exploration of Oil and Gas (http://kazenergy.com/images/ nationalreport15_english.pdf ). At the end of 2015, oil transportation through the Atassu -Alashankou pipeline in the direction of China was 11.8 Mt (http://www.kmg.kz/en/manufacturing /oil/kazakhstan_china/ ), while in 2018 oil transportation through the Kazakhstan- China pipeline dropped by 48% to 1.4 Mt (https://www.kazenergy.com/upload/docu ment/energy -report/NationalReport 19_en.pdf ). In 2019, however, over 10.9 Mt of crude oil w as delivered to China through the Kazakhstan -China pipeline (https://oi lcapital.ru/news/export/21- 01- 2020/pochti -11-mln-tonn-nefti-poluchil -kitay-iz-kazahstana- v-2019- godu ), and i n January 2020 Kazakhstan had to suspend exports of oil to China due to poor Kazakhstan Chapter 1.

All rights reserved. fuel quality caused by an excess of organochlorine compounds (https://ru.sputniknews.kz/economy/20200128/12664743/eksport -kazakhstan- neft-china- minenergo.html ). Kazakhstan’s distribution pipelines reached a tota l length of 49 000 km in 2019. In 2015 , domestic gas consumption was 12.1 bcm, or more than 2.5 times consumption in 2000 ( http://www.kaztransgas.kz/files/KTG_annual_report_ 2015_eng.pdf ). It rose to 13.7 bcm in 2017, 14.9 bcm in 2018 and 15.1 bcm in 2019 (https://www. kaztransgas.kz/images/01_reports/annual -2019 -rus.pdf ). The South Kazakhstan Regi on (or Oblast ) has been receiv ing gas from the Aktobe Region since completion of the Beineu-Bozo i-Shymkent pipeline in 2016 connecting west ern Kazakhstan with the densely populated southern region. With a capacity of 10 bcm/y, this line decreases Kazakhstan’s dependency on Uzbek and Turkmen gas (http://energo.gov.kz/index.php?id=49 ). It also connects to Line C of the Central Asia Gas Pipeline (CAGP) network to eventually supply exports to China ( http://kazenergy.com/images/NationalReport15_English.pdf ).

Pipeline gas is currently available in only 10 of Kazakhstan’s 14 regions, with the 4 remaining regions in the north and centre relying on coal and LPG. M ore than 3 million people have gained access to piped gas in the past seven years, with connections expanding from 30% in 2013 to 52% in 2019 and amount ing to more than 9 million citizens . In December 2019, the first section of the Saryarka gas pipeline was commissioned. It is expected to provide natural gas to the Central Kazakhstan cities of Nur -Sultan, Karaganda, Temirtau and Zhezkazgan , and to 171 settlements along the main gas pipeline (approximately 2.7 million people) by 2040 ( https://ww w.kaztransgas.kz/images/01_reports/annual -2019- rus.pdf ). One of the largest investment project s in the oil and gas industry is the Kazakhstan- China gas transit pipeline. In 2016, construction of three lines of the transnational Turkmenistan- Uzbekistan- Kazakhstan- China gas pipeline were completed , to eventually allow transit gas volumes to increase from 30 bcm/y to 55 bcm/y when compressor stations in Line C are operational (http://www.kaztransgas.kz/files/KTG_annual_report_2015_eng.pdf ). Expansion of the Beineu- Bozoy -Shymkent pipeline’s capacity is expected to increase stable export supplies of marketable gas to China to 10 bcm per year. Kazakhstan Chapter 1. Energy security Country overview PAGE | 16 IEA. All rights reserved. KazTransGaz (KTG) is responsible for i mproving and developing the country’s gas infrastructure. In 2010 , it began constructing compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations and delivering CNG to improve the region’s environmental situation and to develop gas for transport (http://www.kaztransgas.kz /files/KTG_annual_report_2015_eng.pdf accessed 04.02.2017 ). Coal Coal is transported mainly by rail, as Kazakhstan has a siz eable rail system operated by the state -owned national company Kazakhstan Temir Zholy joint - stock company (NC KTZ JSC) . Although coal is essentially a low -margin line of business for the rail industry, it is crucial because it constitutes the greatest turnover (in tonnes shipped and i n tonne -kilometres [tkm]) of any single product for the railroad system. High transportation costs, due to long distances between production sites and consumers , render Kazakhstan’s coal relatively expensive for consumers and reduce its competitiveness ev en in the Russian market. In fact, u p to 40% of the final price of coal is made up of transportation costs (https://inbusiness.kz/ru/news/ugolnoj -otrasli -nuzhna- gospodderzhka ). Because tariffs for us ing the main railway networks and railway services increased in 2019, the Association of Mining and Metallurgical Enterprises has called for state support of the coal industry ( https://inbusiness.kz/ru/news/ugolnoj -otrasli - nuzhna- gospodderzhka ). Around 25- 30% of total coal produced is exported (mainly to Russia ), but due to the limited competitiveness of Kazakhstan’s coal in international markets and the expected decline in export s to Russia, the domestic power sector is expected to become the main consumer of Kazakh coal. Kazakhstan’s coal mines are particularly gassy and coal mine methane (CMM) accumulates to concentrations of up to 33 cubic metres ( m³) per tonne in deep coal mines in the Karaganda basin, making its removal (“drainage”) a safety imperative. Among KTG’s investment activit ies is a prospecting project to produc e CMM at Karaganda coal basin. However, a pre-feasibility study of CMM in Karaganda showed that CMM quality in the mines is not sufficient at current gas market prices to support projects for CMM enrichment for pipeline, CNG, or liquefied natural gas ( LNG) applications. Nevertheless , it has been demonstrated that small -scale elec tricity generation at the production sites could be feasible (http://kazenergy.com/images/NationalReport15_English.pdf ).

It also monitors the reliability and safety of el ectricity production, transmission, supply and consumption. The c ommittee inspect s the technical condition of power plant , grid and consumer energy equipment. In addition, it keeps records on investigations of significant consumer electricity blackout s and damage to large power equipment, and its investigations of major technological failures in the power and electricity networks led to the unified energy system being divided into several parts. Departments of energy and housing utilities of local administ rations ( akimats ) are responsible for the stable operation of heat sources and electrical networks, provi sion of normative fuel suppl ies, uninterrupted provision of electricity and heat to the cities and districts of the region, and equipment repair s for the upcoming heating season.

Oil State -owned KMG is an integrated national oil and gas company implementing national policies on oil and gas sector developments and is involved in oil and gas exploration, production, refining, transportation, distribution and servicing. The company also establishes management systems for subsoil use. Kazakhstan’s “ Big 3” projects are the Tengis Consortium (TCO) , the Kashagan Consortium (NCOC) and the Karacha ganak Consortium (KPO) , responsible for 54 Mt of oil production (60% of Kazakhstan’s total output) . KMG owns equity in these three projects , and in 2018 its t otal equity in crude oil production was 23.6 Mt (38% of which was in the Big 3), while its fully owned subsidiaries are UzenMunayGas (5.5 Mt of production) and EmbaMunayGas (2.9 Mt). CNPC owns majority stakes in AktobeMunayGas and PetroKazakhstan , parity ownership in North Buzachi , and stakes in NCOC. In addition, 78 smaller companies produced 9 Mt of oil (10.5% of total output ) (https://www.kazenergy.com/upload/document/energy -report/NationalReport 19_en.pdf ). KTO, nominally a subsidiary of KMG, owns the main network, and certain other pipelines are owned and operated by consorti ums of investors in which KTO is a shareholder (Caspian Pipeline Consortium [CPC] exports through Russia to world markets, and the Atasu- Alashankou and Kenkiyak -Atyrau pipelines export to China). The three main refineries are owned by KMG, although Shymkent is owned by a joint venture between KMG and CNPC. Kazakhstan Chapter 2. Market design Country overview PAGE | 20 IEA. All rights reserved. Oil product marketing and distribution is reasonably competitive, with multiple companies operating over 4 000 retail stations in the country. The three largest retail chains are KMG, Helios and SinoOil, together holding 16% of the retail market. Two types of contracts for subsoil use have been employed in Kazakhstan: production sharing agreements (PSAs) and regular contract regimes. In January 2009, however, a Tax Code was introduced with stricter provisions than previous tax legislation. Under this Code, PSAs were no longer permitted and the Code alone establish ed provisions for the payment of taxes and levies relating to subsoil operations, although the small number of PSAs already concluded prior to 2009 were “grandfathered” (i.e. considered exempt from the new Tax Code ) (http://kazenergy.com/images/NationalReport15_English.pdf ). New amendments to the Tax Code (effective 1 January 2018) introduced an alternative tax option to stimulate upstream exploration and investment development of offshore and ultra- deep hydrocarbon deposits (https://www.inform.kz/ru/v -kazahstane- vveden- al- ternativnyy -nalog- na-nedropol -zovanie_a3410605 ). In November 1997, the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA) was signed, and in January 2009 the NCOC took over from Agip KCO as operator under the NCSPSA. NCOC acts on behalf of a consortium of seven international companies: K MG, Eni, Shell, ExxonMobil, Total, ConocoPhillips and INPEX. Gas Most gas pipeline infra structure in Kazakhstan , except for pipelines built for specific projects (e.g. C AGP) , is owned and operated by KTG, an affiliate of the fully state -owned enterprise K MG and a vertically integrated TSO/DSO holding company. Regional gas distribution and sal es also are carried out by KTG and its subsidiaries , and g as processing is done at four major gas processing plants (GPZs) built by specific upstream projects. KMG owns one legacy plant (KazGPZ) operating in Mangistau Region (http://kazenergy.com/ images/NationalReport15_English.pdf ). Coal/peat As of April 2014, 12 large coal producers in Kazakhstan, both private and state- owned, held 98% of national output. The private company Eurasian Resources Group (ERG ) has about 30% shares in the country’s total production of steam coal, while Samruk -Energo (representing state interests) and RUSAL (privately Kazakhstan Chapter 2. Market design Country overview PAGE | 21 IEA. All rights reserved. owned Russian Alumini um) each hold about 20%. Almost all coking coal is produced by privat ely owned ArcelorMittal (mainly for its own use at the Karaganda steel plant). Coal is shipped to domestic and international consumers using the rail way network managed by the state- controlled monopoly NC KTZ JSC (http:// kazenergy.com/images/NationalReport15_English.pdf ). Nuclear State -controlled KazAtomProm (KAP) ( http://www.kazatomprom.kz/en ) is the main company in the nuclear industry, but most mining activity is done through joint ventures between KAP and foreign investors. Its entitlement production is about 56% of Kazakhstan’s total output. Kazakhstan has 22 uranium production contracts, with 70% of production"}

Uranium oxide exports are tightly regulated by the state and specially designed railway cars are used to transport uranium to export markets. Large hydro Kazakhstan's major hydroelectric stations are in the east and south, mainly on the Irt ysh River. The Shulbinskaya HPP is the third station in the Irtysh cascade of HPPs and the largest in Kazakhstan in terms of installed capacity (702 MW ) (https://shges.kz/ ). The Ust -Kamenogorsk HPP with installed capacity of 355.6 MW is the second stage of the Irtysh cascade of HPPs and it serves as the counter -regulator of the Bukhtarma HPP ( https://www.ukges.kz/ ). The Bukhtarma HPP has 9 units of 75 M W each, with a total capacity of 6 75 MW (http://kazzinc.com/ru/%D0%91%D1%83%D1%85%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80% D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%B3% D0%B8%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%8D%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%80%D0 %B3%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B 8%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B A%D1%81 ). The Bukhtarma HPP , which is part of the Kazzinc company under a long-term concession, is integrated into Kazakhstan’s national energy system a s the peak -load power plant that regulates the energy supply. Kazakhstan Chapter 2. Market design Country overview PAGE | 22 IEA. All rights reserved. Large HPPs in south ern Kazakhstan include Moinak H PP JSC (300 MW) (https://moynak.kz/ru/ ) and SC AlES Kapchagay HP P (364 MW) (http://www.ales.kz/ru/about -company/35- podrazdeleniya/70- ales- kapchagajskaya- ges). Renewable energy Since fixed rates for renewable energy were introduced in 2014, there have been significant renewable energy development s in Kazakhstan . In 2017 auctions for renewable energy were introduced, in addition to the existing fixed feed -in-tariff support system. The Ministry of Energy expects that auctions will reduce the cost of electricity generated from renewable energy sources (https://abctv.kz/ru/last/pervye -aukciony -vie-v-kazahstane- provedut -v-aprele- 2018- god). Auctions aim to select feasible projects and establish competitive prices for renewable electricity. At the end of 2019, Kazakhstan had 90 renewable energy facilities with a total installed capacity of 1 050 MW ( 284 MW of wind power plants; 542 MW of solar power; 222 MW of small hydroelectric power stations; and 2.4 MW of bioenergy). At least 3 000 MW of in stalled capacity is expected to be operational by 2025, since contracts with a single purchaser Financial Settlement Centre of Renewable Energy for 2 600 MW have already been concluded (210 MW are in the process of being concluded and 190 MW have been conc luded through bilateral agreements). Auction rates are also subject to annual indexation: 30% for inflation and 70% for changes in foreign exchange rates. Energy efficiency The government body primarily responsible for implement ing energy efficiency policies is the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development . Other responsible bodies are the Ministry of Education and Science, the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the Agency on Regulation of Natural Monopolies, the Construction and Communal Services Committee , the Committee on Energy Inspection and Control, the JSC Institute of Electricity Development and Energy Saving, the Kazakhstan Energy Auditors Association and the Electric Power Association (http://www.iea.org/publications/ freepublications/publication/PC_CleanEnergyTechnologyAssessmentMethodolo gyPilotStudyKazakhstan_WEB.pdf ). Kazakhstan Chapter 2. Market design Country overview PAGE | 23 IEA. All rights reserved. In October 2017 , a mechanism to financial ly support energy service projects (i.e. subsidised loans) was launched i n co- operation with the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ), the Ministry of Investment and Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the JSC Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund. The Damu fund works on a revolving format , so that money invested in energy -saving projects return s to banks that will then continue to lend to green projects (https: //expertonline.kz/a15778/ ). By February 2020, 100 projects in the amount of more than KZT 11 billion had been supported, 36 of which (worth KZT 2.1 billion ) have already been implemented. These p rojects aim to improve the energy efficiency of residential and public buildings as well as tourist facilities ; install LED lighting ; moderni se boiler and pump installations ; and enlarge the use of renewable energy sources. Financial and market factors for the development of energy efficiency and for investment in energy -efficient technologies in the industry sector are not encouraging . There is no one fund dedicated to financi ng energy efficiency programmes, and no specific financial instrument for offering loans with favourable options to enterprises for invest ing in planned measures. Kazenergy also stress ed the predominance of restrictive mechanisms in the established legal framework, with a virtual absence of investment -encouraging provisions or incentives. Many legislative requirements adopted in relation to industry sector energy consumption (energy consumption standards, capacity factor requirements, and a ban on incandescent lighting fixtures) have not yet yielded substantial positive results (http://kazenergy.com/images/National Report15_English.pdf ). According to Kazenergy (2019), only eight energy service contract s were concluded during 2015- 18. The l imited employment of energy services contracts results from complicated return- on-investment procedures (https://www.kazenergy.com/ upload/document/energy -report/NationalReport19_en.pdf ). Amendments to the Law on Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency were therefore developed and discussed in 2020, includ ing support measures for energy service contracts: i) reimburs ing part of energy service companies ’ costs for implement ing energy -saving and energy -efficiency projects ; and ii) subsidi sing part of the remuneration and/ or offering partial guarantees for borrowed funds. Another obstacle is that energy service companies ’ lack of collateral prevents them from developing projects at scale. T he draft law therefore proposes partial guarantees on loans issued by financial institutions and also includes clauses giving investment preference to energy service companies for large -scale development of energy service projects. For sectors not covered by the State Kazakhstan Chapter 2. Market design Country overview PAGE | 24 IEA. All rights reserved. Energy Register, it is suggested that voluntary energy audits be conducted to allow fo r any irrational use of energy resources to be identified quickly . Two types of energy audit s (mandatory and voluntary ) are defined, divided into full, targeted and express energy audits. Furthermore, t he draft law authorises local municipalities to devel op, approve"}

It also envisages the development and implementation of a long -term National Population- Oriented Information Campaign. Regulatory framework Energy efficiency The Law on Energy Conservation and Energy Effic iency with amendments and additions of 15 January 2019 is the primary legislation governing energy efficiency measures in Kazakhstan (https://online.zakon.kz/Document/ ?doc_id=31112351#pos=2; -106). The IEA has proposed 25 c ross-sectoral recommendations that have been partially implemented by Kazakhstan:  Data collection and indicators. The Committee of Statistics publishes the Fuel and Energy Balance of the Republic of Kazakhstan; however, it does not comply with IEA format and energy efficiency indicators are difficult to track . Surveys to specifically track energy efficiency in the industry sector have not been conducted in Kazakhstan, so n ational action plans use ener gy intensity of GDP as a main indicator for energy efficiency , and sectoral energy efficiency indicators are not used to track improvements. Survey s on fuel and energy consumption in households were conducted in 2018, and household energy efficiency indica tors are to be developed.  Strategies and action plans. The Energy Efficiency 2020 Programme adopted in 2013 was declared to be no longer in force (http://adilet.zan .kz/rus/docs/P1300000904 ).  Com petitive energy markets, with appropriate regulation. Regulated retail tariffs are not fully cost -reflective and do not always account for the cost of modernisation. Much of the distribution sector is therefore stagnant and unable to replace obsolete infrastructure. Consumers are unaware of the true cost of energy and are not given incentiv es to save energy or to gain an understanding of its true cost. According to the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development ( OECD), in 2011 in Kazakhstan the average fossil fuel subsidy covered about 33% of the full cost of supply. E stimated total fossil fuel subsidies Kazakhstan Chapter 2. Market design Country overview PAGE | 25 IEA. All rights reserved. in 2011 were USD 5.85 billion, which was about 3.3% of the country’s GDP. Most of the subsidies went to oil and petroleum products (55%), follow ed by electricity (30%) and coal (10%) (https://www.oecd.org/env/outreach/Energy% 20subsidies%20and%20climate%20change%20in%20Kazakhstan.pdf ).  Private investment in energy efficiency. Restrictive mechanisms predominate in the legal framework, with virtual ly no investment -encouraging provisions or incentives (http://kazenergy.com/images/NationalReport15_English.pdf ).  Monitoring, enforcement and evaluation. As per the Law on Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency, the s tate is responsible for the accuracy of information provided to the State E nergy Regist ry on meeting energy efficiency requirements for buildings, on complying with energy consumption norms , on conducting energy audits and on implement ing energy management system s. For the Energy Efficiency 2020 Program me adopted in 2013 but no longer in force , no information was found on its monitoring and evaluation.  Mandatory building codes and minimum energy performance standards (MEPS ). According to new legal acts, the main indicator of building energy efficie ncy is the class ification system that assesses how efficiently a building uses heat. P ermitted classes of energy efficiency of new and renovated buildings are: A (very high), B (high) and C (normal). Thus, minimum heating need s should be below level-C heating-need values (https://www.zakon.kz/4515580- mint-rk-i-proon- razrabotali -trebovanija.html ). All new buildings must have metering devices and automated heat supply s tations under the Law on Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency.  Aiming for net -zero energy consumption in buildings . This has not been addressed in the current legislation.  Improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings. The Law on Energy Conser vation and Energy Efficiency introduced energy service contract s under which speciali sed energy service companies provide a set of services for saving energy : the company’s own expenses are reimbursed, and it profits financial ly from any energy savings achieved. Another incentive to improve energy efficiency is a different tariff for heat for consumers who have a heat metering device installed .  Energy labels or certificates for buildings . The energy efficiency class of an existing building is determined by audit results , and it is then specified in the technical passport of the building; the energy audit is also attached to the building’s technical passport.  Improved energy performance of building components and systems. This has not been addressed in the c urrent legislation.  Mandatory MEPS and labels for appliances and equipment. According to the Law on Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency , all energy -consuming equipment must have an energy efficiency class label. The l ist of energy - consuming devices t o which this requirement applies is established in the technical regulations of the Customs Union, which define the class categories Kazakhstan Chapter 2. Market design Country overview PAGE | 26 IEA. All rights reserved. and energy efficiency characteristics. Assessment and labelling are done by the manufacturer or importer.  Test standards an d measurement protocols for appliances and equipment. No information is available.  Market transformation policies for appliances and equipment. No information is available.  Phaseout of inefficient lighting products and systems. Selling and us ing electric i ncandescent lamps of 25 W and above has been prohibited (effective 1 January 2014) , as is the procurement of such lamps by state agencies and entities , and by the quasi -public sector. However, c onstruction norms and regulations on n atural ambient lighting and artificial lighting adopted in 2002 do not correspond with modern requirements on energy efficiency , so updated construction norms that take new energy efficiency requirements and the prohibition of incandescent lamps into account are needed (http://www.kazenergy.com/images/stories/dor_karta/obzor_effect.pdf ). Although requirements for energy -efficient lighting are expected to become more stringent, there are obstacles to widespread use, particularly a lack of quality control of products on the market. It is therefore necessary to develop methods to assess the quality of lighting products and to amend construction norms (http://lighting.eep.kz/en/ ). According to the latest Kazenergy report (2019), despite the ban on incandescent lamps taking effect five years ago, 60% of households still use"}

No information was found on measures to promot e energy -efficient lighting systems. Kazenergy recommends that incentives in the form of grants or subsidies be introduced to help regional and local authorities install high-performance public street lighting throughout the country as soon as possible.  Mandatory vehicle fuel efficiency standards. Kazakhstan’s large refineries were designed to produc e low-octane gasoline grades such A-72 and A-76, but there are num erous additives in the production process that affect the quality of the fuel and ultimately the efficiency of combustion engines (http://www.energycharter.org/fileadmin/DocumentsMedia/Thematic/EE - Kazakhstan_2014_en.pdf ). Originally, Kazakhstan was to produce and handle Euro 4 and Euro 5 motor fuel s from 1 January 2016, but the Council of the Eurasian Economic Comm ission amended the relevant technical regulations so that the use of Euro 2 and Euro 3 gasoline and d iesel fuel was extended to 1 January 2018 (https ://kapital.kz/economic/46044/chto- meshaet -npz-rk- vypuskat -benzin -evro-4-i-evro-5.html ). Owing to the modernisation of three oil refineries in 2018, they are now able to produce K -4 and K -5 fuels (corresponding to the Euro 4 and Euro 5 grades ).  Measures to improve vehicle fuel efficiency. In 2015 requirements for the efficiency of transport (road, aviation, rail, marine and electric) were adopted with Ministry for Investment s and Development Order No. 342 of 26 March 2015 on Kazakhstan Chapter 2. Market design Country overview PAGE | 27 IEA. All rights reserved. Approval of the Permissible Parameters of Vehicles Intended to be Driven on the Roads of the Republic of Kazakhstan (https://tengrinews.kz/zakon/ pravitelstvo_respubliki_kazahstan_premer_ministr_rk/tpanspopt/id- V1500010962/ ). Among other things, t he order mandates Euro -4 emission standards and year-of-manufacture restrictions for vehicles . However, there are financial and economic barriers to reducing transport energy consumption, and no stimulus has been offered for the introduction of energy -efficient transportation. The lack of fuel efficiency labelling for new vehicles is another problem , and car exhaust quality should be inspected annually (http://www.alatransit.kz/sites/default/files/energy_efficiency_in_transport_sector _of_the_republic_of_kazakhstan.pdf ).  Fuel-efficient non -engine components. E nergy efficiency labelling of tyres is not being conducted (http://www.alatransit.kz/site s/default/files/energy_efficiency _in_transport_sector_of_the_republic_of_kazakhstan.pdf ).  Improv ed vehicle operational efficiency through eco -driving and other measures. There is no information available.  Transport system efficiency. Transport system efficiency, involving urban plannin g, the optimal integration of residential, business, commercial and cultural zones, and the adequacy of public transportation, is low but improving. The lack of navigation- time systems to optimi se transport logistics seriously hinder s public transport energy efficiency (http://www.alatransit.kz/sites/default/files/energy_ efficiency_in_transport_sector_of_the_republic_of_kazakhstan.pdf ).  Energy management in industry. The State Energy Registry was established for industrial enterprises consuming more than 1 500 tonne s of coal equivalent (tce) per year , and energy audits at least every five years are mandatory . All subjects of the Energy Registry with annual energy consumption of at least 100 000 t ce can voluntarily sign an agreement with the state authority and local municipality to reduce energy consumption by 15% within five years. (http://kazenergy.com/images/NationalReport15_Engl ish.pdf ). Previously, the Law on Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency ’s Article 10 (on energy management ) required large enterprises to conduct energy audits and develop energy saving action plans , but it was excluded in 2015. According to the Kazenergy (2019) , fines or other penalties for failure to implement energy saving program mes were never established, which resulted in limited execution. Additionally, procedures to conduct energy audits and to monitor their results have not yet been fully developed (https://www.kazener gy.com/upload/ document/energy -report/NationalReport19_en.pdf ).  High -efficiency industrial equipment and systems. Under the Law on Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency , all energy -consuming equipment must have an energy efficiency class label , but n o measures relate to industrial equipment specifically .  Energy efficiency services for small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs). In 2018, the government -UNDP project tested a financial support mechanism that subsidi sed part of energy conservation and ener gy efficiency project Kazakhstan Chapter 2. Market design Country overview PAGE | 28 IEA. All rights reserved. remuneration (up to 10%) and/ or partially guaranteed borrowed funds (up to 50%). A total of 103 projects were supported.  Complementary policies to support industrial energy efficiency. No information is available.  Energy utilit y invol vement in promoting energy efficiency. Electricity and heat prices are currently mostly regulated and do not cover the full cost of investments . Increasing investments in the energy sector and making energy efficiency feasible will require that market incentives be delicately balanced with state steer age. The most important challenge in transitioning to market pricing is the potential impact of any market changes on end- user pricing (http://kazenergy.com/images/NationalReport15_English.pdf ). Electricity In the 2009- 15 period, the Cap Rate Program me – a tariff in exchange for investments – effected the required development of the electricity supply system . With implementation of the program me, about 3 GW of additional install ed capacity was launched and 5 GW of existing electrical facilities were moderni sed. The implementation of cap rates had a positive impact on the work of the large electricity generat ion companies SevKazEnergo JSC, Atyrau CHPP JSC, Astana -Energy JSC, Stepnogorsk CHPP LLP, Pavlodarenergo JSC, AES Ust-Kamenogorsk CHPP JSC and GRES -2 of Kazakhmys Energy LLP (http://www.korem.kz/rus/o_kompanii/godovye_otc hety/ ). Power plants reduced their marginal cost s after former President N. Nazarbayev at the Security Council in November 2018 instructed them to reduce electricity tariffs. However, less than a year later, the Ministry of Energy allowed most power plant s to raise their prices to cover rising transport, fuel, renewable energy subsidy and other costs (https://inbusiness.kz/ru/news/mi nisterstvo- energetiki -povysilo -predelnye- tarify - dlya-bolee- 30-elektrostancij ) by approving new cap rates for electric ity for a group of energy -producing organi sations ( https://w ww.zakon.kz/4988180- izmeneny -predelnye- tarify -na.html ). In April 2020 , the JSC Central Asian Electric Power Corporation’s First Deputy D. Turganov announced that the approved cap rates are considerably below the actual"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_KazakhstanEnergyProfile_10", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\KazakhstanEnergyProfile.pdf", "text": "cost of electricity production. Turganov also declared that t he approved capacity tariff does not cover the costs of energy enterprise moderni sation and reconstruction ( https://www.zakon.kz/5018396- tma-v-kontse- tonnelya- naskolko -serezny.html ). Renewable energy The Green Economy Concept, target ing 50% alternative and renewable energy in the energy mix by 2050, and t he Action Plan for the Development of Kazakhstan Chapter 2. Market design Country overview PAGE | 29 IEA. All rights reserved. Alternative and Renewable Energy for 2013 -20 were adopted in 2013. The action plan envisages the launch of 106 renewable energy facilities with a total installed capacity of 3 054.6 MW: 34 wind farms (1 787 MW), 28 solar power facilities (713.5 MW), 41 small HPPs (539 MW) and 3 biofuel power plants (15.05 MW) (https://greenkaz.org/images/for_news/pdf/npa/koncepciya- po- perehodu.pdf ). In 2019, 21 renewable energy facilities were commissioned , bringing the total number to 90, with a n overall capacity of 1 050 MW. Renewable energy sources were used to generate 2.4 billion kWh of electricity in 2019, a 77.8% increase from 2018. The share of renewable energy in total electricity production is therefore 2.3% (https://forbes.kz/news/2020/02/25/newsid_219828 ). Another 18 renewable energy facilities with a total capacity of 605.5 MW are planned for 2020, with renewables- based generation expected to reach 3 billion kWh (https://forbes.kz/news/2020/02/25/newsid_219828 ). Regional markets and interconnections Electricity Interregional electricity transmission in Kazakhstan in 2015 was 37.89 terawatt hours (TWh) , including 10% transit flows between Russia and Kazakhstan. Historically , Kazakhstan has imported power from Kyrgyzstan’s HPPs , mostly during the country’s power -rich spring , but in 2015 electricity was export ed and import ed between Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzst an for irrigation needs only; t otal electricity purchased and sold was about 0.25 TWh. No unscheduled electricity was supplied from Kazakhstan to Uzbekistan in 2015, and i mport flows from Russia to Kazakhstan amounted to 1.5 TWh ( 7.3% lower than in 2014), whereas export flows to Russia were 1.03 TWh ( 67% less than in 2014) (www.kegoc.kz/1.1.%20KEGOC%20ANNUAL%20REPORT.pdf ). The concept for a single electricity market was approved by the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council in May 2015. To provide consumers the freedom to choose a power supplier, Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Belarus have agreed on conditions for form ing spot markets and a common electric power trading platform on the basis of bilateral contracts (http://www.pravo .by/document/?guid=3871&p0=F91500078 ). Kazakhstan Chapter 2. Market design Country overview PAGE | 30 IEA. All rights reserved. Gas Kazakhstan’s g as transmission infrastructure consists of the following pipelines:  Central Asia -Centre: capacity 60.2 bcm/y; length 3 962 km; operator Intergas Central Asia JSC  Bukhara- Ural: capacity 8 bcm/y; length 1 576 km; operator Intergas Central Asia JSC  Orenburg- Novopskov: capacity 14.6 bcm/y; length 382 km; operator Intergas Central Asia JSC  Kazakh stan-China (А and В lines) : capacity 30 bcm/y; length 3 909 km; operator Asian Gas Pipeline LLP  Zhanaozen- Aktau : capacity 2.8 bcm/y; length 432 km; operator KTG -Aimak JSC  Beineu -Bozoi -Shymkent : capacity 13 bcm/y (as of 2019) ; length 1 454 km; joint venture between KM G subsidiary KazTransGaz and CNPC subsidiary Trans - Asia Gas Pipeline  Bukhara gas -bearing area- Tashkent -Bishkek -Almaty: capacity 5.8 bcm/y; length 1 597 km; operator Intergas Central Asia JSC. These gas pipelines are used for the international transit of T urkmen and Uzbek gas through Kazakhstan towards Russia and China. Total i nternational gas transit ed through Kazakhstan in 2014 was 78.6 bcm: 49.3 bcm of Russian gas ; 25.6 bcm of Turkmen gas ; and 3.7 bcm of Uzbek gas (https://www.kaztransgas.kz/index.php/ru/32- o-kompanii/494- transportirovka- i- marketing -gaza ). Oil Oil e xports are critical to Kazakhstan’s economy. The main challenge of oil production is t he long distances involved in moving crude oil to markets , leading to high transportation costs and export routes that involv e transit countries (http://www.kazenergy.com/images/N ationalReport15_English.pdf ). The m ain operative oil export routes are the Atyrau -Samara pipeline; the Caspian Pipeline Consortium; the Atassu -Alashankou pipeline; and the Aktau sea terminal. The Caspian Pipeline Consortium transported the largest amount of Kazakh oil in 2018 (54.3 Mt). Exports through the Atyrau -Samara route totalled 8.8 Mt to the Ust-Luga terminal on the Baltic Sea and 6.9 Mt to the Novorossiysk port on the Black Sea. Only 1.4 Mt was e xport ed via the Kazakhstan -China pipeline in 2018 (https://www.kazenergy.com/upload/document/energy -report/National Report19_en.pdf ), but over 10.9 Mt went through the line in 2019 (https://oilcapital.ru/news/export/21 -01-2020/pochti -11-mln-tonn- nefti-poluchil - kitay-iz-kazahstana -v-2019- godu ). In January 2020 Kazakhstan had to suspend Kazakhstan Chapter 2. Market design Country overview PAGE | 31 IEA. All rights reserved. oil exports to China due to poor fuel quality resulting from an excess of organochlorine compounds (https://ru.sputniknews.kz/economy/20200128/ 12664743/eksport -kazakhstan- neft-china- minenergo.html ). Historically , most of Kazakhstan’s crude oil exports have been to Mediterranean countries (79% in 2003 and 73% in 2005) , but s ince 2005 there has been significant growth in exports to non- Mediter ranean European countries (i.e. north-western Europe) and especially to China ( http://www.kazenergy.com/images/ NationalReport15_English.pdf ). Kazakhstan Chapter 3. Sustainable develop ment Country overview PAGE | 32 IEA. All rights reserved. Chapter 3 . Sustainable development Renewable energy Small hydro In 2019, the total installed capacity of small hydro was 224.6 MW and 1 105.3 million kWh of electricity was generat ed (https://www.gov.kz/memleket/ entities/energo/documents/details/12625?lang=ru ). Solar According to KOREM ’s report for 2018 , electricity generation from solar power plants (SPPs) was 137.9 million kWh in 2018, which is 53.6% higher than the 89.9 million kWh in 2017 (https://www.kazenergy.com/upload/document/energy - report/NationalReport19_en.pdf ). Solar generat ion capacity is provided by the Kapshagay SPP (2 MW) in the Almaty Region; Burnoye Solar -1 and Otar in the Zhambyl Region; SKZ-U LLP SPP in the Kyzylorda Region ; and the Ochistnoy and Akbay SPPs of Aksu- Energo LLP in the South Kazakhstan Region (https://www.korem.kz/details/ndownload.php?fn=5079&lang=rus ).

Sustainable develop ment Country overview PAGE | 33 IEA. All rights reserved. Geothermal Kazakhstan possesses considerable mid- and low -temperature thermal water resources . Total thermal water resources are estimated at 520 megawatt s thermal (MW th) (free-flow operation) or 4 300 MW th (pumped ). Proven resources from the Cretaceous formations in south ern and south -west Kazakhstan (Panfilov field) for elec tricity production are 12 MW th. The m ain thermal water areas are located near the cities of Shymkent, Almaty and Kyzylorda , and on the Caspian Sea coast (http://www.energypartner.kz ). Biomass Only 4% of Kazakhst an’s overall territory (over 10 million hectares ) is occupied by forests , with 4.7 million ha covered with saxaul (Haloxylon) . The energy potential of timber waste is more than 200 kilotonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe), that of animal waste is 52 ktoe, and electricity generation potential from agricultur al residue is estimated at 87 gigawatt hours (GWh) per year (http://www.energypartner.kz ). In addition, the Biokhim wheat -based ethanol plant in n orthern Kazakhstan was to be brought back in to operation in 2020 (https://inbusiness.kz/ru/last/zavod- biohim -perenes -sroki -zapuska -linii-po- proiz vodstvu -bioetanola ). There is potential for biomass development i n large farms and agricultural enterprises with animal husbandry or crop cultivation. The m ain waste residues in such farms include manure, crop residues and slaughte ring residues. Kazakhstan has the following potential estimated volumes of available waste residues : 1.5 Mt of manure (dry), 0.1 Mt of slaughtering residues ( wet), and 5.1 Mt of crop residues ( dry) (https://www.ebrd.com/cs/Satellite? c=Content&cid=1395284589614&pagename=EBRD%2FContent%2FDownload Document ). In cities, municipal solid waste separation could produce biological waste for energy use , with an available 5.4 Mt of waste, of which the amount of bio waste is 2.0 Mt (37%) (https://www.ebrd.com/cs/Satellite?c= Content&cid=1395284589614&pagename=EBRD%2FContent%2FDownloadDo cument ). Waste According to the Ministry of Ecology, Geology and Natural Resources , of all the industrial waste produced in 2016, 26.8% was process ed and utilised; 30.9% was used in 2017 and 32.2% in 2018 . The share of municipal solid waste (MSW) Kazakhstan Chapter 3. Sustainable develop ment Country overview PAGE | 34 IEA. All rights reserved. recycl ed and used amounted to 11.5% in 2018, 9% in 2017 and 2.6% in 2016 (https://www.gov.kz/memleket/entities/ecogeo/documents/details/5522?lang=ru ). Kazakhstan produces 5-6 Mt of MSW annually; it is sorted and processed at factories in Nur -Sultan, Shymkent and Zhanaozen, as well as by various SMEs . In fact, more than 130 enterprises process recycled materials in the country, producing more than 20 types of products: plastic, metal, wood, glass, paper, crumb rubbe r and rubber products ; biogas ; fertilisers ; and pyrolysis fuel. Kazakhstan had 3 521 landfills at the end of 2018, of which only 17.6% were officially legal. Landfills negatively affect the environment, particular ly the quality of groundwater, soil cover and atmospheric air, and are a source of infection, rodents, and disease vectors. In 2019, authorities banned the disposal of plastic, paper and glass at landfills without prior sorting ( https://rus.azattyq.org/a/kazakhstan -problemy -utilizatsii- i-pererabotki -otkhodov - v-kazakhstane/29741211.html ). Construction of the GreenRecycle LLP waste sorting complex in Almaty was completed in 2018 . The plant has a capacity of 550 kt, with production of 50 kt of secondary raw materials planned (31% polyethylene terephthalate [ PET], 24% cardboard, 8% cellophane, 29% glass, 7% plastic and 7% metal) (https://kursiv.kz/news/vlast -i-biznes/2018- 12/nazarbaev -poruchil -otkryt - musoropererabatyvayuschie- zavody- v-astane- i?page=89 ). The Green Economy Concept aims to have 40% of all waste recycled by 2030 and 50% by 2050 (http://gbpp.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/04/Green_Concept_En.pdf Accessed 21.02.2017 ). A program me of expanded producer and importer liability took effect 1 January 2016, requiring importers and goods manufacturers to pay recycling fees . An approved list of products (goods) is subject to extended producer (importer) obligations, and t he ROP Operator LLP oversees the recycling program me, collect ing payments and administer ing collected funds. The ROP Operator also launched a compensation programme for disposing of old vehicles (https://www.kursiv.kz/examination/blog/kto -budet -platit -za-utilizaciu -othodov -v- kazahstane/ and https://recycle.kz/ ). The s eparate collection of solid waste is gradually being introduced in Kazakhstan. With the financial support of the ROP Operator , 12 196 containers for separate collection were installed in 10 regions and in the city of Nur -Sultan; 147 collection points were introduced in 8 regions ; and 28 speciali sed vehicles were purchased in 2018- 19. In 11 regions, 2 321 containers for mercury - containing lamps and chemical power sources were installed Kazakhstan Chapter 3. Sustainable develop ment Country overview PAGE | 35 IEA. All rights reserved. (https://www.inform.kz/ru/naskol -ko-effekt ivno-rabotaet -koncepciya- rop-v- kazahstane_a3620805 ). In 2017, a plant for the uti lisation of obsolete cars was launched in the Karaganda region ; it has accepted 121 477 vehicles for recycling and processed 102 000 old cars ( https://tengrinews.kz/kazakhstan_news/12- milliardov -tenge -vyidelil- operator -rop-sbor-pererabotku- 385762/ ). Energy efficiency In terms of energy intensity of GDP (the energy intensity of primary energy in megajoules [ MJ] per 2011 USD at purchasing power parity [ PPP] of GDP ), Kazakhstan was 31st in the world in 2015 according to the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.EGY.PRIM.PP.KD?most_recent_value_ desc=true ) because of its severe continental climate, long and cold winters, the prevalence of energy -intensive sectors in its economy, its large territory and extensive transport infrastructure (oil and gas pipelines, electricity transmission lines and water ducts). Due to the availability of affordable coal and relatively low regulated energy tariffs ( for heat, gas and electricity)"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_KazakhstanEnergyProfile_12", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\KazakhstanEnergyProfile.pdf", "text": ", the attractiveness of investi ng in energy -saving projects remains low (http://kazenergy.com /images/NationalReport15_Engl ish.pdf ). Some progress has been made, however, with t he Law on Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency , which introduced :  A procedure for conducting energy audits to assess energy efficiency and to implement energy supply management systems at major industrial enterprises and other buildings .  Facilities for training energy auditors and managers as well as for conducting research activities .  Energy service contracts .  A ban on incandescent lighting fixtures and on sales of e lectrical products without energy efficiency grade indication.  Differentiated payment s for heat consumption depending on whether heat metering is installed (http://kazenergy.com/images/NationalReport 15_English.pdf ).  Compliance with energy consumption standards and normative capacity coefficient value s in power grid networks .  Review s of new construction projects for energy efficiency and energy savings (https://www.kazenergy.com/upload/document/energy -report/NationalReport 19_en.pdf ). There is significant potential for energy efficiency in buildings in Kazakhstan. Average residential energy consumption (270 kWh/m²) exceeds that of the Kazakhstan Chapter 3. Sustainable develop ment Country overview PAGE | 36 IEA. All rights reserved. European Union (100 kWh/m² to 120 kWh/m²) and Russia (210 kWh/m²). For new residential construction, the Law on Energy Saving and Energy Efficiency specifies the use of modern energy -saving materials and the installation of automated heating systems and utility metering devices. For existing residential structures, the Law requires that such materials, heating systems and devices be installed during capital repair s or reconstruction (http://kazenergy.com /images/NationalReport15_English.pdf ). Fuel switching Under the Green Economy Concept , investments are needed for the creation of gas infrastructure in the North, E ast and South regions to enable co-generation plants to switch from coal to gas in all large cities. This would result in lower local emissions and better air quality and would ensur e flexible backup capacity for intermittent renewable energy sources. Electricity generated by coal plants would remain at the current level until 2030 , but gas in power generation would double to 8 bcm/y by 2030, from 4 bcm/y in 2012 ( http://gbpp.org /wp- content/uploads/2014/04/Green_Concept_En.pdf ). In 2014 , the government approved a General Scheme for 2015 -30 to delineate the country’s access to gas. A realistic scenario involves expanding distribution pipelines i n regions that already have access to gas and constructing new branch pipelines to regions located near main pipelines (in western and s outhern Kazakhstan). More than 3 million citizens have been provided with piped gas in the past seven years (as of 2020), extending gas access to more than 9 million residents (a rise from 30% in 2013 to 51% in 2019) (https://www.kaztransgas.kz/images/01_reports/annual -2019- rus.pdf ). Since 2016, t he Beineu- Bozoi -Shymkent pipeli ne has been moving gas from the country’s western gas production regions to southern areas . Construction of the Saryarka gas pipeline was started in November 2018 to provide gas to Nur - Sultan as well as to central and northern Kazakhstan by 2023. I n Octobe r 2019 the first stage of construction from Kyzylorda to Nur -Sultan was completed (https://ru.sputniknews.kz/ economy/20191129/12161758/Vtoraya- ochered - gazoprovoda- Saryarka- otsenivaetsya- v-124-milliona -dollarov.html ). In only a short time, 1 061.3 k m of pipeline, five powerful automated gas distribution stations and a gas measuring station had be en built (https://informburo.kz/novosti/gazoprovod- saryarka -vveli-v-ekspluataciyu- Kazakhstan Chapter 3. Sustainable develop ment Country overview PAGE | 37 IEA. All rights reserved. 100415.html ). The pipeline’s capacity of 2.2 bcm per year is expected to provide gas to 171 settlements and 2.7 million people in the Karaganda and Akmola regions. Also in 2016, Gazprom Export and LLP Global Gas Regazification, part of the Global Gas Group Company, signed the first -ever contract to supply small - tonnage LNG by road from R ussia to Kazakhstan. In 2017 , 320 kt of LNG was delivered from Yeaketerinburg to Nur-Sultan. In February 2017, the first LNG regasification complex (Turan) was launched in Nur-Sultan within the framework of the A stana LNG 2020 project , with the first consu mer being Nazarbayev University (https://globalgas.kz/ru/company/press -center/news/otkrytie- krspg - turan/ ). Gazprom Transgaz Yekaterinburg LLC delivered 7.7 kt of LNG to Kazakhstan in 2018 and more than 9 kt in 2019. Thus, in 2019 the company increased Kazakhstan’s LNG supplies by 16.9% (https://inbusiness.kz /ru/last/gazprom -v-2019 -godu -uvelichil- postavki -spg-v-kazahstan -na-17). Enviro nmental protection Kazakhstan suffers from land degradation, desertification and water scarcity as a result of past military nuclear testing programmes and industrial and mining activities . As s imilar conditions prevail throughout the Central Asia region, in 2010 Kazakhstan established the Green Bridge Partnership Programme for sustainable development within the region and beyond. In Central Asia, the programme addresses issues related to energy and water linkages. In addition, Kazakhstan has ratified more than 20 international environmental treaties. They provide the basis for its national environmental regulatory framework, which includes national laws, presidential decrees and government resolutions. The Ministry of Ecology, Geology and Natural Resources administers environmental protection in Kazakhstan, and t he 2007 Environmental Code is the country’s basic legislative framework for any activity r equir ing environmental protection (http://adilet.zan.kz/ ). An environmental permit is required for any emissions of pollutants into the environment , for wastewater discharges and waste disposal in the environment , and for open storage of sulphur. S tate authorities apply fines for environmental offences , or suspend or cancel the environmental permit (https://iclg.com/practice -areas/environment -and-climate - change -law/environment -and-climate -chang e-law-2016/kazakhstan ). Kazakhstan Chapter 3. Sustainable develop ment Country overview PAGE | 38 IEA. All rights reserved. However, some important environmental concerns are the absence of coal -fired power plant ash and slag waste management systems ; inadequate ash capture in coal -fired power station stack s; and air and water pollution at mineral resource extraction and processing sites (http://kazenergy.com/images/NationalReport 15_English.pdf ). Current air pollutant emission s standards in Kazakhstan fall well behind those of the European Union , and most of Kazakhstan’s cities suffer from poor air quality ("}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_KazakhstanEnergyProfile_13", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\KazakhstanEnergyProfile.pdf", "text": "https://www.annalsofglobalhealth.org/articles/10.5334 /aogh.2535/ ). Extremely high risks of developing the chronic effects of heavy - metal exposure were detected in Ust -Kamenogorsk, Shymkent, Almaty, Taraz and Balkhash. According to the Green Economy Concept , more stringent standards for emissions of particulate matter, sulphur dioxide ( SO 2) and nitrogen oxide ( NO x) have to be adopt ed (http://gbpp.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/04/Green_Concept_En.pdf ). Kazakhstan’s current emissions standards are less stringent than those of OECD countries and China. Permissible emissions of solid particles by coal -fired power plants in Kazakhstan are several times above EU limits . Kazenerg y (2019) therefore stresses the introduction of high-performance double- blow electrostatic precipitators, combustion optimisation systems and sul phur oxide control systems to reduce emissions in priority areas (https://www.kazenergy.com/upload/document/energy -report/National Report19_en.pdf ). Climate change Kazakhstan submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris in September 2015, with a pledge to reduce greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission s by 15- 25% from t he 1990 level by 31 December 2030. It ratified the Paris Agreement in December 2016, and the target of 15% including emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) is unconditional , while the 25% target (also including LULUCF) is contingent on access to additional international investments, low - carbon technology transfer mechanisms, green climate funds and flexible mechanisms for countries with economies in transition. The unconditional target is equivalent to a 13% increase in emissions in 2020 compared with 2012, and 1% increases in 2025 and 2030 (http://climateactiontracker.org/countries/ kazakhstan.html ). The latest national inventory indicates that Kazakhstan’s GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) in 2017 were 353.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide Kazakhstan Chapter 3. Sustainable develop ment Country overview PAGE | 39 IEA. All rights reserved. equivalent (MtCO 2-eq), 8.5% lower than in base year 1990 ; GHG emissions from the energy sector accounted for 82 % of total emissions. GHG emissions from fuel combustion in Kaz akhstan can be clear ly divided into two periods: a gradual decrease from 1990 to early 1999, and slower growth with small fluctuations since 2000 (http://unfccc.int/national_reports/annex_i_ghg_inventories/ national_inventories_submissions/items/9492.php ). Kazakhstan approved its emissions trading scheme (ETS) in 2011. In Phase I (2013) , allowance surrender obligations were imposed on 178 companies and the cap was set at 147 MtCO 2 (plus a reserve of 20.6 MtCO 2), equivalent to 2010 levels. Phase II (2014 -15) cover ed 166 companies and the cap was set at 155.4 MtCO 2 for 2014 and 153 MtCO 2 for 2015 – i.e. reduction targets of 0% in 2014 and 1.5% in 2015 compared with the average CO 2 emissions of capped entities in 2011- 12. The Phase III (2016- 20) cap is set at 746.5 MtCO 2 (plus a reserve of 21.9 MtCO 2) and 140 companies are affected . The first two phases included free allowances, with the possibility of introducing auctioning in Phase III. The allocation of allowances was based on an historical approach and in 2016 it was proposed that allowances be distributed based on benchmarking. In early 2016, emissions trading was suspended until 2018 t o adjust and improve the distribution system of quotas. In April 2018 V ice-Minister of Energy Mr Zhaksaliyev announced that 76 enterprises had chosen the historical approach and 149 had chosen benchmarking. The historical method for allocating quotas is based on the average value of emissions for the previous time period, while benchmarking compar es the intensity of emissions relative to the output. The national quota allocation plan adopted in January 2018 sets a total emissions cap for 129 companies for 2 018-20 (https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/?option=com_etsmap&task=export&format=pdf &layout=list&systems%5B%5D=46 ). Kazenergy (2019) claim s that benchmarks are designed to give more free allowances to coal -fired than gas-fired plants because the emissions intensity of coal-based electricity was 0.985 tCO 2/MWh in 2018, while it was only 0.621 tCO 2/MWh for electricity generated from other fuels (fuel oil and natural gas). Such a policy therefore reduces the incentive to switch from coal to gas for power generation (https://www.kazenergy.com/ upload/document/energy -report/National Report19_ru.pdf ). Recent model ling indicates that Kazakhstan’s -15% INDC target is rather ambitious and would require the expedited construction of pipelines to regions lacking access to gas . The success of the ETS and the measures prescribed by Green Economy Concept are not sufficient to reach this goal , so additional Kazakhstan Chapter 3. Sustainable develop ment Country overview PAGE | 40 IEA. All rights reserved. efforts are needed in the non-ETS transport, agriculture, waste and residential sectors (https://www.ucc.ie/en/media/research/iew2016/BakytzhanSuleimenov.pdf ). Technology research, development and deployment In 2015, the National Agency for Technological Development (NATD) distributed KZT 1.6 billion (almost US D 100 million at the 2015 exchange rate) to support 51 projects. The government’s priorities include the development of : information and communications technology ( ICT) for the telecommunications sector ; renewable energy resources ; new materials ; pharmaceutical products ; and, last but not least, new oil and gas sector technologies and innovations (https://www.cacianalyst.org/publications/analytical -articles/item/13397- technoparks -in-kazakhstan- will-they-help- develop -the-innovation- sector?.html ). Financial support for development in science and research in Kazakhstan comes mainly from the national budg et through several types of funding: basic ; program me-targeted ; and grant s. In 2018, domestic research and development (R&D) expenses amounted to KZT 72.2 billion , or 0.12% of Kazakhstan’s GDP. This s hare has been in continuous declin e for the past five years (https://kursiv.kz/news/ekonomika/2019 -05/uvelichit -raskhody -na-nauchno - issledovatelskie -raboty -predlagayut -deputaty ). However, at a government meeting chaired by Prime Minister Askar Mamin in December 2019, it was decided that education and science expenditures should increase to 7% of Kazakhstan's GDP by 2025 (https://primeminister.kz/ru/news/rashody -na- obrazovanie- i-nauku- k-2025- godu- vyrastut -do-7-ot-vvp-kazahstana ). The Technology Commerci alization Project, an initiative of the World Bank Group’s Trade & Competitiveness Global Practice and the Government of Kazakhstan, provided grants to scientists between 2008 and 2015 . The project initiated 65 new science -based start -ups in agriculture, g as, oil, medicine and other areas ("}

We are experiencing a growing demand for energy with volatile energy prices, a realignment of global supply chains, an increasing awareness of environmental responsibility, and the need to combat climate change. The issue of depreciation and inevitable aging of the industry's infrastructure becomes particularly acute, which pushes us towards the development of new energy security and risk management strategies. At the same time, along with the emergence of global challenges, we also gain unprecedented opportunities. The rapid develop- ment of technologies, including renewable energy sources, innovations in energy eﬃciency, modern energy storage methods and digitalization open up new horizons for our industry. We can use these opportunities to create a more sustainable, reliable, eﬃcient and \u0000exible energy system. In current conditions, the KAZENERGY National Energy Report 2023 is an important mechanism for assessing the current state of the energy sector in Kazakhstan, as well as determining strategic prospects and priorities for the coming years. The report represents the result of collaboration between the KAZENERGY Association's professionals, Kazakhstani and international experts, representatives of business, the scienti\u0000c community and government agencies that cooperate closely with the KAZENERGY Association. An important aspect of the Report 2023 was the KAZENERGY team's work on the conceptual vision for the development of the Energy Security Strategy of the Republic of Kazakhstan and a serious study of the experience of the world's advanced economies.T oday, the application of a systems approach to planning the development of an eﬃcient energy complex in the republic, which allows for a reduction of these risks and increases the competi- tiveness of the economy, is of particular relevance for Kazakhstan. The Government of the country and the national energy community consistently implement systemic changes to regulate the industry and solve ambitious tasks in the \u0000eld of decarboniza- tion of the national economy outlined by the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart T okayev. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all participants of the KAZENERGY National Energy Report publishing project. Your contribution, expertise and suggestions are key elements of its value and credibility. I hope that the KAZENERGY National Energy Report 2023 will form the basis for further dialogue and cooperation between government agencies, business and the scienti\u0000c community, and will become an independent guide for the development of a balanced state policy and making important decisions that promote sustainable development of the energy sector of Kazakhstan. Sincerely, Timur Kulibayev Chairman KAZENERGY AssociationLadies and Gentlemen, Dear Readers! 2 Yet again we have the distinct honor of participating in the preparation of The KAZENERGY National Energy Report 2023 for Kazakhstan (NER 2023). This marks our \u0000fth edition of this signi\u0000cant Report covering the importance, diversity, successes, and challenges of Kazakhstan's energy sector. This year also marks two important 30-year anniversaries in Kazakhstan: both the T engizchevroil joint venture (TCO) developing the T engiz \u0000eld and the KazakhstanCaspiyShelf Consortium (KCS) that became the NCOC (North Caspian Operating Company) developing the Kashagan \u0000eld were established in 1993. This Report comes at another critical juncture for Kazakhstan and the world as a whole. Global disruptions in energy markets from the ongoing military con \u0000ict in Ukraine have raised the importance of energy security in overall policy-making. The push for renewable energy and the drive toward net-zero carbon emissions remain important goals, of course, as the global consensus around climate change and the energy transition becomes stronger. But the enormous challenges to that transition are also becoming clearer. In addition to the uncertain pace of the development and deployment of clean-energy technologies, four issues in particular stand out: (1) the reemphasis on energy security as a prime requirement for countries; (2) lack of consensus on how fast the energy transition should and can take place in diﬀerent places across the globe, in part because of its potential economic disruptions; (3) a sharpening divide between advanced and developing countries on priorities in the transition; and (4) obstacles to expanding mining and building supply chains for the minerals needed for the net-zero objective. The \u0000rst issue, energy security, is a key theme of NER 2023, as it has particular salience for Kazakhstan. Globally, the concern over energy security had faded somewhat over the previous few years. But the 2022 energy shock, the economic hardships that ensued in diﬀerent quarters, skyrocketing energy prices that could not have been imagined two years ago, and geopolitical con\u0000icts—all have combined to force many governments and companies to reassess their energy transition strategies. This reassessment recognizes that the energy transition needs to be grounded in energy security—that is, adequate and reasonably priced energy supplies—to ensure public support and avoid severe economic dislocations. It is useful to view the role of coal in Kazakhstan's economy through this particular prism—despite"}

For Kazakhstan, the energy sector is the very foundation for its overall economic security and well-being. Although Kazakhstan's economy has experienced considerable development and some diversi \u0000cation in the three decades since independence, hydrocarbons and other energy resources still remain central in the national economy. The oil and gas industries alone, together with related sectors (e.g., oil and gas transportation, upstream construction, and geology), contributed around 20% of the country's GDP in 2022, with oil accounting for 60% of Kazakh export earnings and constituting the primary source of the government's budgetary revenue. The development of the oil and gas industry has been a source of strength, generating economic activity, employment, and revenues that have been crucial since 1991 in solidifying Kazakhstan's independence as a nation and improving the incomes and standards of living for its people. It has also for ti\u0000ed Kazakhstan's relations with its neighbors and established the country as a reliable partner and major force in the global oil industry and a signi\u0000cant participant in global markets, the world community, and global aﬀairs.Dear Readers ! THE NATIONAL ENERGY REPORT KAZENERGY 3 But this also increases the national economy's vulnerability to external shocks. More speci\u0000cally, the economy's heavy reliance on hydrocarbon revenue increases its sensitivity to swings in global oil prices, as repeatedly demonstrated in recent years. Notably, both the contraction of Kazakh GDP in 2020 and subsequent strong rebound (in 2021) largely paralleled world oil price trends, while the slowing of national GDP growth in 2022- 23 re\u0000ected the deceleration of oil price growth in 2022 and price decline in 2023. Notwithstanding these vulnerabilities, the energy sector generally, and the hydrocarbon industry in particular, is expected to remain a key driver of Kazakh economic growth throughout the outlook period to 2050. Given the importance of the energy sector within Kazakhstan's economy, revenues from exports of hydrocarbons and other energy resources will be essential for economic div ersi\u0000cation initiatives and for funding the country's ongoing transition to low- carbon energy in the future. But Kazakhstan will face increased competition for scarce foreign investment capital worldwide (including from other major hydrocarbon-producing countries). Investor-companies will still compete for new opportunities, but they are exercising much greater capital discipline, increasing the competition among resource-holding countries for available investment in new projects. It will be important in this new environment for Kazakhstan's policymakers to take steps, through enlightened \u0000scal and other policies, to demonstrate they are holders of “advantaged” supplies that can be developed, produced, and delivered at relatively low cost and with a low carbon footprint and, at the same time, with reasonable regulatory certainty and timely decision-making. These are the key criteria on which international companies will make their investment decisions. Yet resilience in response to macroeconomic shocks and creation of an attractive investment environment are but two dimensions of Kazakhstan's energy security warranting attention in NER 2023. This includes the importance of diversi \u0000cation of Kazakhstan's oil export routes, as the West's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has dramatically reoriented the geography of global oil and gas trade and greatly increased transit risk. Other elements of Kazakhstan's energy security include raising the overall resilience of the country's electrical grid (increasingly important in accommodating both greater elec tri\u0000cation and a larger share of intermittent renewable generation entering the grid as part of decarbonization eﬀorts) and more energy storage. Finally, the importance of policy resilience—broad public agreement regarding the direction of decarbonization and overall energy policy—cannot be ignored. We believe that a key approach needed to enhance overall policy resilience is to ground the energy sector within a broader market-economy framework, with market supply and demand fundamentals driving prices and allocating resources. This includes adoption of a general open- trade stance internationally with respect to energy. If energy securit y is the \u0000rst challenge of the transition, timing is the second. The energy transition will be an extremely challenging, multidecadal process that will require extraordinary changes in energy use, technology, and policy. How fast should it—and can it—proceed? There is much pressure to accelerate a signi\u0000cant part of the 2050 carbon reduction emission targets toward 2030. But it sometimes seems that the scale of what is being attempted is underestimated. In investigating Kazakhstan's energy transition and greenhouse gas reduction initiatives, and comparing them with decarbonization programs undertaken internationally, we oﬀer recommendations for the reform of one of the more important elements of Kazakhstan's Low-Carbon Development Strategy to 2060—the Emissions Trading System. We observe the paradox for Kazakhstan is that while the reduction of coal consumption in the electric power sector is the single most eﬀective step it can take toward reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, coal—when used judiciously—can also be an important near-term stabilizer (energy “security blanket”) in what will likely be a bumpy transition path. Another source of stability is international collaboration, as evidenced in Kazakhstan's participation since 2020 in the organized crude oil production cuts by the OPEC+ group of major world producers. OPEC+ has helped to stabilize global energy markets, driving world oil prices up from very low levels (and with that, export revenues for oil exporters) by managing global supply to more closely correspond with demand. Another area of broad regional cooperation that could enhance security in the energy space is the pending formation of single markets within the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) for oil and oil products, natural gas, and electric power. Accession to the EAEU single markets provides a mechanism whereby Kazakh energy prices can gradually rise to parity with those in fellow EAEU member-states (particularly Russia) as part of a general movement toward integrated open markets. Higher energy prices will provide clear bene\u0000ts by increasing the eﬃciency of energy consumption (in the process lowering GHG emissions) and reducing unauthorized (“grey”) exports to consumers in bordering countries. Energy security concerns have now also modi\u0000ed, although not"}

On the eve of the con\u0000ict in Ukraine, many hydrocarbon producers expected to reach maximum oil and gas output earlier and at lower levels than forecasted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and pursued portfolio diversi \u0000cation, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), divestments, and new clean-energy ventures to r e\u0000ect this expectation. But energy security concerns stemming from rising prices and disrupted supply chains following the outbreak of the con\u0000ict in Ukraine have caused many industry executives to reassess their business plans and approaches to the transition in general. In the current strong demand environment, some “ \u0000rst mover” companies in the energy transition have pushed back the timetable for reducing oil and gas production. The international oil majors are concentrating their activities closer to home geographically, in better known geological and political environments, while exercising increased capital discipline. National oil companies, although a diverse group, generally have continued to focus on monetizing their hydrocarbon resources as eﬀectively as possible in an increasingly competitive investment environment. Nonetheless, this change in approach is more a mid-course correction than a major reorientation of transition strategy. Companies continue to emphasize increasing cost-eﬃciency in their operations and embracing powerful technological innovations (big data, cloud computing, ar ti\u0000cial intelligence) to cut costs and boost production from existing assets. Many also continue to execute plans to become more div ersi\u0000ed energy companies by building out renewable energy capacity, electric vehicle charging stations, and carbon capture, use, and storage (CCUS) installations. And there is a growing recognition that substantial progress toward reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will require the THE NATIONAL ENERGY REPORT KAZENERGY 4 use of both proven low-carbon technologies such as wind and solar power in electric power generation, as well as technologies currently only at the experimental phases, such as hydrogen in sectors that are more diﬃcult to decarbonize (heavy industry and transportation). This does not mean that hydrocarbon energy resources will no longer be important. They will continue to play a major role in the world economy throughout the outlook period (to 2050). However, the focus will increasingly shift to reducing their climate impact and increasing the eﬃciency of their consumption. We present NER 2023 at this key juncture in the development of Kazakhstan's energy sector with the same sense of optimism and purpose as our \u0000rst Report issued back in 2015. Our shared goal is to contribute to and advance an ongoing process of understanding, and with it decision-making and policy formation, that will enable Kazakhstan to meet its energy, security, and environmental challenges while promoting the economic and social welfare of its population. Dr. Daniel Yergin Vice Chairman S&P Global October 2023THE NATIONAL ENERGY REPORT KAZENERGY 5 The KAZENERGY National Energy Report 2023 was prepared by the KAZENERGY Association (with active participation from its members) and by S&P Global together with Avantgarde Advisory. However, it builds on a foundation established by many years of previous research and analysis undertaken by many diﬀerent experts, both within Kazakhstan and abroad. These specialists come from a diverse array of organizations, including KAZENERGY Association members, state authorities of the Republic of Kazakhstan, many research, development, design and engineering entities, as well as companies operating in the sector. The contributions of all these experts are essential and gratefully acknowledged. This most recent Report is published in 2023 as the world deals with the after-eﬀects of an energy shock brought on by global geopolitical tensions and changes in the world order. This year also marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment in Kazakhstan of two multi-national consortia developing the T engiz and Kashagan oil and gas mega-projects. It is a reminder of Kazakhstan's emergence, in just a few short decades, as a major player in global energy markets and a stable partner in the energy space internationally. Preparation of NER 2023 during a period of international geopolitical turbulence and disrupted trade \u0000ows and travel arrangements presented some research challenges, including in obtaining data and making outlooks. We are grateful to the entities that took the time to conduct both virtual and on-site interviews with the research team. We are also grateful to the KAZENERGY member companies and governmental agencies that responded to information requests and provided indispens- able written feedback, data inputs, and insights. We especially thank the Avantgarde Advisory represented by its General Director, Ruslan Mukhamedov, as well as Oleg Arkhipkin, who were actively involved in preparation of this Report and provided the content of the electric power, coal, and uranium chapters, as well as Ekaterina de Vere Walker of SEEPX, who developed the electric power chapter, along with contributions from Andrey Kibarin, Tatyana Polyanichkina, and Alisher Kurbanaliev. Numerous specialists within and outside Kazakhstan also reviewed individual chapters of the Report corresponding to their individual areas of expertise. We genuinely appreciate their suggestions and comments. We especially thank Timur Kulibayev, Chairman of the KAZENERGY Association; Uzakbay Karabalin, Deputy Chairman of the KAZENERGY Association; Kenzhebek Ibrashev, General Director of the KAZENERGY Association; and Rustam Zhursunov, Ombudsman for the Protection of the Rights of Entrepreneurs of Kazakhstan. This Report would not have been possible without their active assistance, expert advice, and support. This Report was published largely due to the support of NC KazMunayGas JSC, NC QazaqGaz JSC, T engizchevroil LLP, a branch of Chevron Munaigas Inc., and a branch of ExxonMobil Kazakhstan Inc. In addition to the individuals and organizations mentioned above, we express our special thanks to a number of individual organiza- tions (industrial enterprises, energy producers, etc.) and their employees who contributed to preparation of the Report.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND ENERGY MARKET DYNAMICS, 2022–23 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK 1.1 Key Points ► As a result of the economic eﬀects of the global COVID-19 pandemic, total global primary energy demand fell by 3.9% in 2020, but then rebounded in 2021 and 2022 to surpass the pre- pandemic level; more speci\u0000cally, global primary energy demand grew by 4.9% in 2021, followed by 1.4% growth in 2022 (to 15.0 billion tons of oil equivalent). Oil (i.e., crude and condensate) continued to be the most widely consumed form of primary energy in 2022, accounting for 30.5% of global primary energy demand, followed by coal (26.8%) and then natural gas (22.9%). ► Among the diﬀerent forms of primary energy, renewable energy increased the most in relative terms (14.0%) in the 2022 primary energy demand mix, followed by oil (2.9%). Surprisingly, coal continued a slow (albeit temporary) upward trajectory, increasing by 1.4%. Gas demand, meanwhile decreased slightly (-0.8%). The reversal in the fortunes of the two fuels – gas and coal – rather than r e\u0000ecting long-term trends, instead was due to a combination of more immediate developments: a dramatic fall in European gas demand as Russia reduced supplies to the Continent as a result of the con\u0000ict in Ukraine, weaker than expected Chinese demand owing to the country's protracted post-COVID economic recovery, and a temporary reversal of net coal-to-gas switching in power generation and industry as gas prices spiked and drought lowered hydroelectric power generation in some regions (e.g., Europe, Eurasia); this left coal to \u0000ll the gap. ► The S&P Global Commodity Insights (base case or expected) outlook for global primary energy demand to 2050 features a steady shift in the 2030s and 2040s toward lower carbon energy sources across most major economies. By the mid-2030s, fossil fuel consumption trends on a consistently downward path, while market penetration by renewables increases steadily. Total primary energy demand increases by 15% (0.5% annually) over the present level by 2050, despite a doubling of global GDP and an increase of global population by some 2 billion; this is the result of a concurrent reduction in energy intensity (2.0% annually) associated with improvements in energy eﬃciency. ► Global liquids¹ demand peaks in the early 2030s, and gradually falls back to 2022 levels by the late 2040s. Although oil loses market share and total demand falls, it remains the largest contributor to total primary energy demand (TPED) even in 2050 (at 4,334.7 MMtoe, 25% of TPED). Natural gas will play an important bridge role to a low-carbon future. The share of gas in TPED in 2050 (22%) is virtually the same as at present (23%), although the volume consumed is projected to be about 12% higher. Similarly, nuclear and hydroelectric power will remain vital sources of zero-emission power generation in the new energy system, although their shares in TPED will not change appreciably from present levels. The most rapid increase in TPED over the 2022–50 period is non-hydro renewables, which increase at an average rate of 7.4% annually, reaching 20% of TPED (nearly seven times the current share). In contrast, coal demand (starting from 2023) falls steadily through 2050, driven by rising competition from gas and renewables and stronger policies restricting coal use. Coal's share in TPED falls by more than half, to 11% in 2050, with absolute quantities consumed decreasing by more than 50%. ► The average real (constant 2022 dollar) Dated Brent crude oil price is expected to be about $74/barrel (b) during 2023-50 in the S&P Global outlook—an increase of over $10/bbl compared with the base case presented in The National Energy Report 2021. This upward shift in the expected price trajectory r e\u0000ects a variety of factors putting additional pressure on producer break-even costs. In particular, supply chain issues have heightened in\u0000ation as the world continues to recover from COVID-19, armed con\u0000ict in Ukraine and the geopolitical fallout have resulted in a higher price “risk premium” while the negative impact of Western sanctions on Russian oil production longer term also remov es a signi\u0000cant stream of lower-cost barrels from the global market. Finally, investors now require higher rates of return before launching major new upstream projects, since the ongoing global decarbon- ization drive weakens the overall global oil demand picture. ► One key consequence of new Western sanctions targeting Russian oil and product exports since 2022 has been to partition global markets between those who buy Russian barrels and those who do not. Western nations that have now generally banned the import of Russian barrels have ended up paying more on average for imports than countries such as India and mainland China—the main recipients of Russian oil redirected from European markets, at deeply discounted prices. Signi\u0000cantly, the countries without sanctions in place against Russia account for about two-thirds of the world's population and a growing share of the global hydrocarbon market. The G7/EU price cap regime, whereby these countries' maritime services are available to facilitate Russian oil and r e\u0000ned product exports so long"}

Voluntary oil production restrictions by the OPEC+ coalition, of which Russia and Kazakhstan are both members, nevertheless continue to limit global oil supply and thereby exert upward pressure on prices. ► Global oil demand and supply growth are concentrated among non-OECD and OPEC countries, respectively, during the scenario period. On the demand side, the non-OECD share of global liquids consumption rises from 54.1% in 2022 to 68.1% in 2050 (and the Asia P aci\u0000c region remains the chief global center of oil demand growth). On the supply side, OPEC liquids output rises by 28% to 44 million b/d in 2050—lifting the OPEC share of total world liquids production from 34% in 2022 to around 44% in 2050. The three largest producers globally during the period out to 2050 are likely to remain the United States along with OPEC+ members Saudi Arabia and Russia (which accounted between them for over 30% of global liquids supply in 2022). 1 Global liquids (or oil) demand \u0000gures are presented as \"total oil liquids,\" which includes crude oil as well as biofuels, liquid petroleum gases, other liquids (including natural gas liquids, gas to liquids, coal to liquids, asphalt, petroleum coke, waxes, lubricants, aviation gasoline, nonrenewable oxygenates, r e\u0000nery additives and oil shale [kerogen]). 14 ► Overall, the development of the national oil and gas sector has continued to serve Kazakhstan well. But the \u0000ip side of the coin of the economy's heavy reliance on hydrocarbon revenue is the vulnerability of macroeconomic trends to swings in global oil prices, as repeatedly demonstrated in recent years. Notably, both the contraction of Kazakh GDP in 2020 and subsequent rebound starting in 2021 largely paralleled world oil price trends, while the slowing of national GDP growth in 2022-23 r e\u0000ected the deceleration of oil price growth in 2022 and price decline in 2023. Although energy sector recovery lifted the national economy in 2022-23, the energy sector has lagged various other sectors of the economy in the post-2020 rebound of investment in \u0000xed capital, indicating relatively weak returns recently. Notwithstan- ding such concerns, the energy sector generally, and the hydrocarbon industry in particular, is expected to remain a key driver of Kazakh economic growth throughout the period to 2050: annual GDP growth is expected to slow over time, but still average 2.6% during 2023-50. ► Comparative analysis of upstream costs in oil-producing countries and an E&P attractiveness country rating developed by S&P Global indicate that Kazakhstan may struggle to compete with certain other international destinations for new foreign investment needed to help \u0000nance additional upstream development. The S&P Global cost curve methodology calculates a relatively high break-even price for a typical new Kazakhstan upstream project (in 2022), of about $67/bbl (i.e., for projects that would begin development over the next few years). For context, most of the new global crude production through 2040, for example, is expected to come from countries where projects break even at $50/bbl or less. Meanwhile, our latest quarterly E&P attractiveness rating placed Kazakhstan in only the 78th spot out of 112 countries, albeit the country's rating has improved somewhat over the course of the past 10 years; key factors accounting for Kazakhstan's relatively low rating include a comparatively high government tax take and correspondingly low rate of return for upstream investors in Kazakhstan. 1.2 General Trends in Primary Energy Demand Global trends in the consumption of energy in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic are being driven by an increasingly complex interplay of underlying forces that appear destined to dramatically alter the trajectory and composition of world energy demand over the next three decades. Primary energy demand is rebounding in the aftermath of the pandemic, but at the same time that the transition to lower-carbon forms of energy is gaining momentum. The uncertainties inherent in this transition are now compounded by a new element—geopolitical turbulence—with the disruption and subsequent reorientation of energy trade \u0000ows resulting from the con\u0000ict in Ukraine now placing energy security at the forefront of many countries' energy and broader economic agendas. These security concerns are shared both by countries that have depended on imports of fossil fuels to sustain their economies and those that rely on energy export revenues to \u0000nance signi\u0000cant portions of their national budgets. A good starting point in eﬀorts to envision where these trends may be leading is to assess the current structure of global primary energy demand (2021 and 2022) coming out of the pandemic. Clearly the eﬀects of the pandemic are evident in the reduction and subsequent recovery of global economic activity: total real global GDP fell by 3.1% in 2020, followed by a strong rebound (6.0% growth) in 2021 and slower growth (3.1%) in 2022.² The trajectory of global primary energy demand was broadly similar, contracting by 3.9% in 2020, recovering strongly (4.9%) to the pre-pandemic level in 2021, with growth slowing (1.4%) in 2022 (see Table 1.1 Global primary energy demand by fuel type, 2019-23). In that year oil (i.e., crude and condensate) continued to be the most widely consumed form of energy, accounting for 30.5% of primary energy demand, followed by coal (26.8%) and natural gas (22.9%). The shares of the other fuels in total global energy demand were decidedly smaller, accounting for 5% or less each. Examination of relative changes in demand for each of the fuels over the period 2021–22 is particularly illustrative, both of near- term disruptions from the Russia-Uk raine con\u0000ict as well as the likely resilience of longer-term trends. The modest growth in global oil (liquids) consumption is consonant with the picture of a gradual recovery in activity as the impacts of the pandemic recede, but the drop in natural gas consumption clearly r e\u0000ects reduced European consumption of the fuel in 2022 as Russia reduced supplies to the Continent, ³"}

European and global spot gas prices surged in anticipation of tight winter 2022 supply, further depressing demand. As a result of the anomalous gas supply picture and resulting high prices, the global trend toward net coal-to-gas switching in power generation and industry was temporarily reversed in 2022, with coal consumption increasing worldwide by 1.4%. Another factor contributing to the rise of regional coal demand in Europe and Eurasia (e.g., Russia) was a warmer and drier spring and summer 2022. This reduced hydroelectric power generation and in Europe nuclear power generation as well, as sources of cooling water were threatened by falling river levels; coal-\u0000red capacity disproportionately received the call to serve as the back-up.⁴ Despite these 2022 deviations in global primary energy demand, other developments demonstrated the persistence or even acceleration of longer-term trends. Demand for renewable energy exhibited double-digit gains (albeit from a small base), well above the 1.4% growth in overall primary energy demand, continuing the momentum of the global energy transition toward renewable electricity and fuels; generation of electric power by wind increased by 14.1% globally in 2022 and solar-generated power increased by 26.7%. GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND ENERGY MARKET DYNAMICS, 2022–23 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK 2 S&P Global Market Intelligence, Economics and Country Risk, Global Executive Summary , 21 June 2023. 3 According to the International Energy Agency, natural gas demand in the European Union fell in 2022 by 55 Bcm, or 13%, its steepest drop in history; see https://www.iea.org/commentaries/europe-s-energy-crisis-what-factors- drove-the-record-fall-in-natural-gas-demand-in-2022. 4 See S&P Global Commodity Insights, Russia Watch, Damage Control: How is Russia's energy industry adapting to intensied Western sanctions and new domestic political and economic constraints? March 2023, p. 50. 15 Table 1.1 Global primary energy demand by fuel type, 2019-23 (MMtoe)GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND ENERGY MARKET DYNAMICS, 2022–23 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK 1.3 Outlook for the Global Energy Mix to 2050 The long-term outlook for world primary energy demand is based on S&P Global's proprietary base-case energy scenario, known as In\u0000ections®. In\u0000ections models future world energy demand and related greenhouse-gas emissions out to the year 2050 on the basis of the following general assumptions: ► Fundamental turning points in international relations, national politics, markets and individual choice and behavior accelerate the global energy transition faster than previously anticipated. ► Greater geopolitical instability drives countries to seek more political, economic and energy security and independ- ence. The global landscape becomes more divided and international relations become more opportunistic and transactional. ► National security interests become closely linked with energy security, which is pursued in diﬀerent ways by countries, depending on domestic politics, energy resource mix, levels of import dependency, and institutional capabilities to alter existing energy systems. Energy security in In\u0000ections largely means pursuit of “all of the above” (fossil fuels [short- to-medium term], clean technology and end-use eﬃciency [medium-to-long term]). ► Key countries pursue industrial policies to develop competitive advantages in clean energy technologies and related industries in what is considered a new type of “arms race.” ► Successful implementation of policies and strategic goals is mixed across the world, aﬀected by politics, market constraints, and practical barriers . Progress in the evolution of energy markets and a pathway to a lower-carbon future is signi\u0000cant, but does not meet expectations, leaving most long-term clean energy and climate goals and aspirations unmet by 2050.⁵ Figure 1.1. presents the In\u0000ections outlook for the global energy mix to 2050, accounting for continuing decarbonization eﬀorts, the resulting shifts in investments among the varied energy 5 S&P Global, Energy and Climate Scenarios/Webinar, Energy and Climate Scenarios 2023 Update: Assumptions, narratives, and preliminary results , 17 May 2023, p. 17; S&P Global, Strategic Report, Energy and Climate Scenarios, Inections 2023–50: The S&P Global Commodity Insights base-case scenario of the energy future , July 2023. In addition to the base-case scenario In\u0000ections, S&P Global models four other global energy and climate scenarios—Discord, Green Rules, Accelerated Carbon Capture and Storage (ACCS), and Multitech Mitigation. Discord assumes that a con\u0000uence of crises worsens geopolitical fragmentation (a tendency in international relations toward a “friend vs. foe” alignment of like-minded nations) and weakens the resolve for collective climate action, resulting in much less progress toward emissions reduction than in In\u0000ections. Green Rules assumes that energy security concerns mobilize strong long-term government actions that align energy security and energy transition measures, leading to more substantial emissions reduc tion than in In\u0000ections, but still not suﬃcient for the world to reach net zero by 2050. АCCS and Multitech Mitigation are two 2050 net-zero scenarios based on widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage economy-wide (АCCS) and strong energy eﬃciency measures and elec tri\u0000cation based on renewables, hydrogen, and nuclear power (Multitech Mitigation).carriers, and S&P Global's basic assumptions concerning national government policy initiatives (see Figure 1.1 Global primary energy demand and GHG emissions: In\u0000ections). The following key, overarching trends can be identi\u0000ed: ► Over the period 2022–50, total primary energy intensity (million tons of oil equivalent [MMtoe] of primary energy consumed per $US million GDP) declines at a compound annual rate (CAGR) of -2.0% ( Figure 1.2 Primary energy see intensity of GDP), while total primary energy demand grows by 15% (to 17,303 MMtoe; CAGR of 0.5%). This occurs despite a doubling of global GDP and population growth of almost two billion people. In short, the eﬀect of GDP growth in increasing energy demand is oﬀset by an approximate doubling of the rate of eﬃciency improvements, relative to the 1990–2021 trend. ► During the 2030s and 2040s, a mix of government policies and actions by corporations pushes a steady shift toward lower carbon energy across most major economies. Fossil fuel consumption is on a consistently downward path, while market penetration by renewables and electric vehicles (EVs) is a story of steady growth. ► Elec tri\u0000cation is the main element in primary energy demand growth through 2050, with renewables greatly outpacing fossil fuels in power generation and transportation.

Liquids demand globally peaks in the early 2030s, and gradually falls back to 2022 levels by the early-to-mid-2040s. Although oil loses market share and total demand falls, it remains the largest contributor to total primary energy demand (TPED) in 2050 (falling to 25% of TPED from 31% at present). ► Natural gas will play a key role in transitioning toward a lower-carbon future in key markets in developed and developing countries, whether through back-up to renewables in power markets, rising low-emission “blue” hydrogen production, or continued use in hard-to- decarbonize sectors such as heavy industry. The In\u0000ections scenario sees gas continuing to play largely a bridge role, with robust demand through the late 2030s, before plateauing thereafter to the end of the forecast period (i.e., gas demand reaches a maximum around the year 2040). The share of gas in TPED in 2050 (22%) is virtually the same as at present (23%), although the volume consumed (3,833 MMtoe) is expected to be about 12% higher. ► Coal demand rebounded in 2021 as a result of post-pandemic recovery and in 2022 as countries pursued short-term energy security measures to address the crisis in gas supply resulting from the Russia-Ukraine con\u0000ict. But this rebound will be short-lived, as coal enters a long-term downward demand trajectory through 2050, driven by steadily rising competition from gas and renewables and stronger policies restricting coal use. Coal's share falls by more than half, from 27% in 2022 to 11% in 2050, with absolute quantities consumed decreasing by more than 50%. This will require a proactive policy response for regions that have traditionally relied upon the production and consumption of coal as a basis for industry and power generation, as coal's decline is expected to adversely impact the economic prospects of coal companies in these regions, with related eﬀects on the social welfare of their populations. ► Renewables. By the 2030s, wind and solar projects are lower cost than fossil fuel generation on a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) basis in most parts of the world—even without subsidies or government protection. However, rapid growth of renewables and EV penetration of road transportation continue to face challenges as demand for strategic materials like lithium and copper often outpaces supplies.

Over time, policy and market responses gradually contribute to expanding sources of key raw materials and diversifying wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing and supplies. Eventually, decentralization of manufacturing occurs as part of a broader reshoring and onshoring trend in many markets. The combination of all these factors results in higher costs for renewables, but not to the extent that it signi\u0000cantly curtails growth. Over the period 2022–50 renewable energy demand increases more than sevenfold, at a CAGR of 7.4%, so that by 2050 its share of TPED (20%) trails only oil and gas among the primary energy sources. ► Nuclear and hydroelectric power will remain vital sources of zero-emission power generation in the new energy system, although their shares in total primary energy demand in 2050 (6% and 3%, respectively) will not change appreciably from at present (5% and 2%, respectively). Nonetheless they will be larger overall, increasing with TPED. By 2050 primary energy demand for nuclear power will be 57% greater than at present, and demand for hydro will be 33% greater. ► The share of modern biomass (including biofuels, biogas, and processed waste wood) in TPED will nearly double from the current level (5%) by 2050 (9%), as the trend toward recycling of plant and animal waste for the production of renewable fuels gains momentum. However, the dedicated use of scarce land strictly for fuel production (given the increasing opportunity cost of producing fuel instead of food on such land) is expected to encounter limits, so the growth trend tapers toward the end of the forecast period. ► In contrast to modern biomass, the share of “other ” forms of primary energy (which includes direct combustion of wood and animal waste as well as net trade in hydrogen in primary energy) remains relatively constant, at 4%. This appears to re\u0000ect the countervailing eﬀects of a gradual decrease in direct combustion of wood and animal waste in developing countries—whose GHG emissions per unit of energy exceed even that of coal—and a slow increase in net trade in hydrogen,"}

It then examines the implications for Kazakhstan's economy and upstream investment development.⁶ 1.4.1 World oil prices: The supply cost curve has shifted upwards Geopolitical factors became a more critical driver of prices for oil along with other commodities in the wake of the February 2022 expansion of armed con\u0000ict in Ukraine and given the ensuing expansion of Western sanctions against Russia—exacerbating new in\u0000ationary pressures that had already sent oil prices sharply upward starting in 2021. ⁷ Although prices so far in 2023 have trended lower than in 2022, the S&P Global outlook is now for a signi\u0000cantly higher average long-term world oil price compared with our outlook at the time of The National Energy Report 2021 . Supply chain issues and heightened in\u0000ation continue to put upward pressure on producer break-even costs—and therefore prices as well—while companies are also seeking higher rates of return to oﬀset the additional upstream investment risks amid the global decarbonization push. Another factor contributing to higher prices is the negative impact of Western sanctions on Russian oil production longer term, as that remov es a signi\u0000cant stream of lower-cost barrels from the global market. Periodic OPEC+ crude oil output restrictions are also likely to buoy prices during various years of the scenario period. The net result is likely to be an average real (constant 2022 dollar) Dated Brent price exceeding $70/bbl during the scenario period to 2050—over $10/bbl above our price outlook in 2021. In short, a higher long- term price environment is now seen as necessary to incentivize suﬃcient long-term supply, notwithstanding the expected peak in global oil liquids demand in the early 2030s in our current outlook .⁸ 1.4.1.1 Recent global oil price and market developments The 2021 surge in the average real Dated Brent price, by 63% to $76/bbl ($71/bbl nominal), was followed by a 34% price jump in 2022, to $101/bbl. Supply chain constraints contributed to much of this price rise starting in 2021, as the global economy rebounded from the 2020 COVID-19 quarantine measures, while another key factor since February 2022 has been global market disruptions following Western nations' adoption of sanctions targeting Russian oil and product exports. The OPEC+ group's continued voluntary curtailment of crude oil production levels provided price support throughout this period as well. Dated Brent reached a monthly high during 2022 of about $124/bbl in June, but during most of the second half of 2022 was under $100/bbl, and prices so far in 2023 have \u0000uctuated in approxi- mately the $75-$95/bbl range. The price downturn in the second half of 2022 and \u0000rst part of 2023 r e\u0000ected the resilience of overall Russian oil export volumes—largely redirected from European to “East of Suez” markets—along with relatively weak demand-side fundamentals given a slowdown of global economic GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND ENERGY MARKET DYNAMICS, 2022–23 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK 6 Here and elsewhere, the term “oil” as used in this report is typically shorthand for overall liquids volumes including both crude oil and gas condensate as well as other types of liquid fuels. Analysis of global oil trends in The National Energy Report 2023 provides oil volumes in barrels, whereas oﬃcial statistics of Kazakhstan and other Eurasian countries typically report regional oil volumes in metric tons. When referencing Kazakh oil volumes speci\u0000cally, however, these are generally provided in metric tons followed by barrel-equivalent estimates in parentheses. Separate metric ton-barrel conversion ratios are used for major individual Kazakh oil streams where applicable. But for aggregated or undiﬀerentiated oil volumes (production, r e\u0000ning, consumption, and export streams), barrelization of these volumes (or capacities) is based on an average 7.3 barrel-per-metric-ton ratio. For more on Kazakh ton-barrel conversion issues, see S&P Global Commodity Insights, Insight, OPEC+ Agreement Accentuates Challenges of “Barrelization” of Oil Production for Russia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan, September 2020. 7 The term “Western” as used in this report is shorthand for the loose coalition of countries that have enacted sanctions against Russia in response to the armed con\u0000ict in Ukraine and is not limited in a geographic sense—it includes countries of the Asia P aci\u0000c region such as Japan and Australia along with EU member nations, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, the United States, and Canada. 8 All dollar prices in this report refer to US dollars unless otherwise indicated. 18 growth. The G7/EU price cap mechanism has contributed to stability of Russian oil as well as product export volumes. The G7/EU decision to make these countries' maritime services available to facilitate Russian oil and r e\u0000ned product sales so long as the price does not exceed a speci\u0000ed level has contributed to the stability of Russian export volumes; i.e., the alternative option of a blanket ban on provision of these maritime services as originally considered would have resulted in a major curtailment of Russian exports given the absence of readily available replacements for many G7/EU services. The price cap regime, introduced in December 2022 for Russian crude oil and February 2023 for re\u0000ned products—corresponding to the EU schedules for imposition of outright bans on the import of Russian crudes and products, respectively—was designed to minimize any potential global reduction of Russian export volumes and resulting price spikes, while simultaneously limiting Russian revenues from such sales. Under terms of the price cap regime, third party countries importing Russian crude and products can contract with Western maritime service providers to conduct this trade if the oil or product sales price falls below the speci\u0000ed caps, and these price ceilings are reviewed periodically by the sanctioning nations with the aim of ensuring that Russian oil and products continue to sell at a signi\u0000cant discount in global markets. The price caps were initially set as follows,"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_NationalReport23_en_10", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\NationalReport23_en.pdf", "text": "and remain at these same levels for now: ► $60/bbl for crude oil ► $100/bbl for products that trade at a premium to crude oil, including diesel (Russia's largest single product export stream), gasoline, and jet kerosene ► $45/bbl for products that trade at a discount to crude oil, including fuel oil and naphtha. The Western sanctions have led to a partitioning of the global oil and re\u0000ned product markets (for the foreseeable future) between those who buy Russian barrels and those who do not. The global oil and products market as it was known since the 1990s, basically ceased to exist in 2022-23. Most of Russia's sales before 2022 were to Western nations that have now generally banned the import of Russian barrels (with a few exceptions). Countries that embargoed Russian volumes ended up paying more for imports, partly due to higher logistical costs. In contrast, India and mainland China in particular have been keen to import discounted Russian barrels shunned by the EU and other traditional buyers. Altogether, countries without sanctions in place against Russia account for about two-thirds of the world's population and a growing share of the global hydrocarbon market, although relatively few of these nations can be considered close partners of Russia. The new geopolitical realities have also had some negative knock- on eﬀects on the price of Kazakhstan's primary export crude grade, CPC Blend, as well as other Kazakh crude oil exports transiting Russian territory. The average CPC Blend discount to Dated Brent widened signi\u0000cantly in 2022, as CPC exports were curtailed amid shipping constraints and rising associated risks. CPC Blend price risks arising from the armed con\u0000ict in Ukraine subsequently eased but remain a concern to buyers; as a result, the spreads have recently remained wider than historical levels. Meanwhile, Kazakh oil exported via the Transneft pipeline marine terminal outlets in the Baltic Sea (Ust-Luga) and Black Sea (Novorossiysk) were initially subject to the same sort of steep discounts as Russia's Urals Blend, but Kazakhstan subsequently managed to sell these export volumes at a premium to Urals by rebranding them in June 2022 as Kazakhstan Export Blend Crude Oil (KEBCO), and thereby diﬀerentiating Kazakh oil from Russian oil (though the quality of KEBCO is identical to that of Urals). Indeed, after trading at a discount to Brent during the second half of 2022 and \u0000rst part of 2023, KEBCO has also traded at a premium to Brent in recent months (even as Urals has remained at a discount to Brent, albeit a narrower discount than before). This positive dynamic partly r e\u0000ects the general tightness of sour barrels in global oil markets due to the OPEC+ reduction of collective crude oil output; Saudi Arabia is playing the lead role in the latest OPEC+ reductions and since it is a producer of relatively sour barrels the net result is to make such crude streams scarcer, boosting their prices generally worldwide, while Russia has also announced a series of new cuts this year that limit the availability of Urals Blend in world markets. In addition, European r e\u0000ners who were dependent on Urals prior to sanctions have scrambled to \u0000nd crudes of similar quality. 1.4.1.2 Near-term and long-term price scenarios In our current outlook, world oil prices drift upwards in the second half of 2023, before weakening slightly (in real terms) in 2024. However, prices are likely to remain relatively volatile going forward, particularly given the dynamic situation with respect to key variables impacting oil balance fundamentals, especially Chinese demand and the production trajectories of Russia as well as Saudi Arabia and the United States. Key assumptions underlying our expectation for price strength- ening in the second part of 2023 include:⁹ ► Global oil demand growth is relatively robust, concentrated primarily in mainland China. Mainland China has contributed more than any other country to 2023 world liquids demand growth, though some mixed macroeconomic signals raise questions about the magnitude of mainland China's growth, both for the economy and oil demand. In the United States, tighter credit will continue to restrain economic growth, but the likelihood of a recession has dropped. ► OPEC+ actions reduce the potential for supply surplus, but substantial production growth outside OPEC+ is a countervailing force limiting the price upside. In autumn 2022, the OPEC+ countries began lowering their collective crude oil output targets in a series of deals (Kazakhstan agreed to an additional 78,000 b/d reduction as part of one of these accords, in April 2023). Meanwhile, however, liquids production by several countries outside OPEC+ grows robustly in 2023. This year, the United States is again the leading source of higher supply, but there are many other notable contributors as well: Canada, Brazil, Guyana, Norway, mainland China, and Argentina.

This price appears adequate to incentivize suﬃcient long-term supply (see Figure 1.3 Long-term crude oil price outlook). Break- even costs have risen sharply, as in\u0000ation, material prices, and supply chain issues have all put upward pressure on costs. Companies are seeking higher rates of return on extraction eﬀorts since risks are rising for upstream investment, as a weakened global oil demand picture clouds the long-term outlook.¹⁰ With respect to CPC Blend diﬀerentials versus other interna- tional crude grades, the outlook is for some reduction of the discount seen recently, given such factors as strong European re\u0000nery demand for CPC Blend as a replacement for Urals (see Figure 1.4 Long-term outlook for CPC Blend diﬀerential to Dated Brent).GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND ENERGY MARKET DYNAMICS, 2022–23 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK Figure 1. 3 Long-term crude oil price outlook ($/b bl)"}

Meanwhile, relatively robust OPEC production accounts for a growing share of global oil supply as both Russian and US production enter long-term decline trajectories. The removal of comparatively low-cost Russian barrels from the supply curve is also supportive of price, insofar as these must be replaced by alternative barrels worldwide that are largely more expensive to produce (as discussed below in 11 Various 2022 baseline numbers for our 2050 global oil supply and demand scenarios consist of S&P Global outlooks for 2022 results in the absence of \u0000nal year-end data.Notes: Real 2022 dollars per barrel.

During 2030-50, key global oil demand dynamics include: ► The accelerating energy transition leads to a peak in global oil (liquids) demand by the early 2030s. ► The postpeak decline in global demand is more rapid than in our previous outlook, as key consuming markets chase net- zero goals, bolstered by newly heightened concerns around energy security. ► Motor gasoline consumption contracts the most, as EV penetration in light vehicle (LV) road transportation accelerates, driven by zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandates in diﬀerent countries and the world's major automakers committing to the transformation of their output away from gasoline- and diesel- propelled LVs and steadily increasing EV manufacturing and sales. ► EV sales also grow in emerging-market economies (driven in many places by rising sales of electric two-wheeled vehicles), outpacing sales in OECD countries by the 2040s.► Notwithstanding signi \u0000cant contraction of gasoline consumption, the transportation sector remains the single largest component of oil demand throughout the outlook period, and in 2050 global motor gasoline consumption still amounts to around 20 million b/d in the base case, while transport diesel demand is equivalent to about 16 million b/d and jet/kerosene demand is roughly 9 million b/d. ► Beyond transportation, the practicality of petrochemical products—and plastics in particular— supports their continued use over the outlook period. ► By 2050, global oil (liquids) demand is approximately 101 million b/d, nearly the same as in 2022, but 8% below the global maximum of the early 2030s. Major oil demand variations among regions in the S&P Global base case include continuing concentration of global demand growth in Asia P aci\u0000c markets (supplied increasingly from outside the region), alongside further contraction of European demand, the onset of long-term US oil demand decline by the late 2020s and moderate growth of demand in Eurasia: ► Asia Pacic region . Asia P aci\u0000c markets register a net oil demand rise of 19% during 2023-50, to 45 million b/d in our outlook. But dynamics within the region continue to vary widely. Non-OECD Asian demand increases by 31% to 39 million b/d, re \u0000ecting expansion of Indian demand in particular (by 77%, to 10 million b/d). Mainland China, with liquids demand of 16 million b/d in 2022, remains the chief non-OECD Asian market by far, but Chinese oil demand plateaus at around 19 million b/d in the late 2030s and falls to around 17 million b/d in 2050, so it only grows by 10% altogether during 2023-50.

Liquids demand among the Eurasian countries is expected to rise to a plateau of around 5 million b/d during the 2030s and 2040s, for a net increase during 2023-50 of 8%. As discussed in more detail below (see Chapter 3), the upcoming establishment of a Single Market among members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) implies a further liberalization of prices across EAEU members states that will tend to limit product demand growth in markets such as Kazakhstan's where prices are currently arti \u0000cially low (compared with product consumption levels in a scenario without such market integration). 1.4.2.2 Global oil supply Throughout the outlook period, oil reserves growth globally and in Kazakhstan, along with production growth, is likely to remain challenged by limited investment in exploration and \u0000eld development as companies focus on capital discipline and return on investment, while confronting ESG (environment-safety- governance) concerns.¹³ Exploration spending contracted markedly overall worldwide during the past ten years, and competition for remaining E&P investment is intense. Global E&P capex fell 57% over 2014-20; a 2021 rise still left spending well below pre-pandemic levels, while E&P capex \u0000nally surpassed pre- pandemic levels in 2022, when such spending totaled about half a trillion dollars (see Figure 1.8 Outlook for world upstream E&P spending). The growth in spending in 2021-22 is a predictable response to a stronger oil price environment, as well as upstream cost in\u0000ation, and in\u0000ation remains a key factor in an expected 11% rise in global upstream capital expenditure to $565 billion in 2023; 5% of the anticipated 2023 increase will come from cost in\u0000ation alone. ¹⁴ The rate of global spending growth and E&P activity is expected to slow beyond 2023, but will remain substantial. Above all, this r e\u0000ects the imperative for new discoveries and production streams to sustain supply at levels necessary to meet world demand in coming decades given ongoing natural decline at pr oducing \u0000elds. The aggregate global base decline rate during the outlook period, including \u0000elds that already are in decline as well as \u0000elds that are currently ramping up or at plateau, is forecast at about 3% per year. The call on new crude and condensate production is about 31 million b/d by 2040, for example, or nearly 40% of 2022 world output. At the same time, key signposts point to companies' increased emphasis on more selective exploration eﬀorts oriented towards “low risk” opportunities.¹⁵ Although access to \u0000nancial resources needed to fund new hydrocarbon projects is likely to remain challenging amid the ongoing energy transition, our (base case) In\u0000ections scenario to 2050 is one in which global lenders nevertheless extend credit on the scale needed to bring on stream the major additional new E&P projects required to both oﬀset depleting \u0000elds and meet incremental oil demand; i.e., growing oil demand globally during the \u0000rst part of the scenario period and a continued rise in oil demand within numerous individual countries during subsequent years. The capital discipline now in vogue, though, is likely to increasingly limit oil companies' scope for spending to those projects that promise the best returns on investment—and, preferably, returns in the near to medium term rather than longer term—but the In\u0000ections investment climate remains more favorable to E&P activity than that found in our alternative scenarios (in our Green Rules scenario, in contrast, \u0000nancing for hydrocarbon projects is more constrained and new upstream projects are at greater risk, r e\u0000ecting the accelerated decarbon- ization eﬀorts and reduced call on hydrocarbons overall in this outlook). At the same time, the In\u0000ections scenario is a world in which investors will also tend to give preference to those projects that can deliver lower carbon, higher value oil production in more sustainable and eﬃcient ways than before. The mix of total liquids supply also undergoes signi\u0000cant changes during the outlook period in terms of both composition and the geography of production (see Figure 1.9 Outlook for world oil (liquids) production).¹⁶ Crude oil's share of total global liquids supply declines from around 78% in 2022 to 74% by 2050, given relatively greater growth of the other components (condensate and other NGLs as well as biofuels and other liquids). With respect to the geographic breakdown of global liquids supply, an important trend in our is robust growth of OPEC liquids output. OPEC production, in turn, becomes more concentrated in the \u0000elds of OPEC's Middle Eastern members (especially Saudi Arabia), while the chief non-OPEC producers during the period to 2050 are likely to remain the United States and Russia (even as these two countries' oil output contracts overall). So called “shale” (or tight) oil production, currently concentrated in the United States, is also expected to continue to play a key role in world oil supply during the scenario period, while Kazakhstan may be poised to join the ranks of the world's “shale” oil producers in coming years (see text box “Prospects for shale (tight) oil development globally and in Kazakhstan”). 15 For example, US shale exploration has evidently entered a new phase: although traditional exploration is also still occurring, companies appear to be focused more than before on development of under-exploited acreage within companies' existing license zones as opposed to targeting discoveries in new drilling acreage; see Energy Intelligence , 'Quiet' Exploration Takes Shape in US Shale Patch , June 8, 2023. 16 The total liquids supply trajectory essentially mirrors the above-noted demand picture in our base case in volume terms; i.e., for modeling purposes, the outlook assumes zero total liquids inventory change—no stock builds or stock draws—on an annual basis (see Table 1.2). 13 S&P Global Commodity Insights, Insight, Global Conventional Exploration Trends: Fears of discovering tomorrow's stranded assets are overriding concerns on resource decient portfolios — for now , May 2023. 14 But Eurasia is an outlier among major world regions in our outlook; while all other regions register an increase in upstream E&P spending during 2023 in the base case, in Eurasia"}

Global tight oil production rises from around 8.4 million b/d in 2022 (of which the US share is around 94%) to a maximum of 11.7 million b/d in 2030 (when the US share is expected to amount to 91%), and then falls to 7.7 million b/d in 2050 (when the US share equates to 86%). Other shale oil producers during the scenario period (listed in order of the volume of their 2022 tight oil crude production) are Canada, Russia, Argentina, and mainland China. In light of Kazakhstan's considerable shale oil potential (given the areal extent of its sedimentary basins), it would not be surprising if the country also eventually emerges as a signi\u0000cant shale oil producer, though much more exploration (and perhaps some actual commercial development) is needed before the scale of the commercially recoverable reserves is known. Key signposts of Kazakhstan's shale oil potential include a 2014 evaluation of the country's technically recoverable shale oil (and shale gas) resources by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). The EIA assessment indicated shales and “other organic-rich source rocks” of Kazakhstan hold a risked and technically recoverable shale oil/condensate resource amounting 10.6 billion barrels, while the in-place risked and technically recoverable resource is 221 billion barrels.¹⁷ In the near term, the prospects for commercial development shale oil development in Kazakhstan hinge mainly on the eﬀorts of the private South Oil company, which in February 2023 became the \u0000rst in Kazakhstan to oﬃcially book shale oil reserves that it discovered in south-central Kazakhstan; speci\u0000cally, in Karaganda and Kyzylorda oblasts (South Turgay Basin, where hydrocarbon accumulations are found at relatively shallow depths). Since 2001, South Oil has owned the rights to subsoil use and exploration of hydrocarbons in contract areas No. 662 and 668, and since 2005 several \u0000elds have been discovered (Kenlyk, Aktau, Yeszhan, YuZ-Karabulak, Akshabulak Vostochny). In 2021, the company also partnered with colleagues from Russia, RN-BashNIPIneft LLC, on a study of deposits in the Lower-Middle Jurassic horizon of the South Turgay Basin. As part of the company's activities, an assess- ment was made of the resource potential of the Karagansay suite, con\u0000rming the oil and gas potential ( speci\u0000cally, well No. 40 in contract area No. 668 registered an oil \u0000ow rate of 0.5 m³/day). Subsequently, on February 22, 2023, the State Commission on Mineral Reserves (under the Committee of Geology of the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development) considered and approved the company's reserves report (“Calculation of shale oil reserves of the Karagansay block of unconventional hydrocarbon sources located in the Karaganda and Kyzylorda regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan”). This, in turn, paves the way for more comprehensive study of the source rocks and subsequent commercial development. At the moment, South Oil is drawing up a work program in accordance with existing legislation, and the company reportedly plans to drill around 15 wells over the next 2-3 years, and 100-150 wells during the next 25 years. However, there are still many uncertainties surrounding the project, including the scale of the discovery, expected production volumes and ramp-up schedule, planned production technologies, development costs, \u0000nancing arrangements, etc. Development of shale oil in Kazakhstan may depend crucially on government support through more favorable above- ground “enablers” than are currently found in Kazakhstan; e.g., tax credits and supportive regulatory policies. Such measures underpinned the US tight oil production boom, for example. The EIA's study also cautioned that several key above-ground factors encouraging North American tight oil development might not apply elsewhere, including “private ownership of subsurface rights that provide a strong incentive for develop- ment; availability of many independent operators and supporting contractors with critical expertise and suitable 17 U.S. Energy Information Administration, Technically Recoverable Shale Oil and Shale Gas Resources: Kazakhstan , September 2015, p.

Through 2030, the following supply-side factors are decisive in our base case outlook: ► Higher oil prices and a renewed focus on energy security are expected to continue to drive global upstream capex. ► S&P Global assumes the implicit oil project internal rate of rate (IRR) requirement has grown from 10% to 20%, re\u0000ecting investor pressure to boost returns and the growing risk that the energy transition creates for oil projects. ► The war in Ukraine has weakened Russia's oil sector in several key dimensions, and it is assumed that the country enters a long-term production decline during this period, with Western"}

However, US crude production is expected to peak in the latter years of the decade. Key drivers evolve during 2030-50 as follows: ► With a peak in global liquids demand in the early 2030s, lower upstream activity is needed to meet demand and oﬀset natural \u0000eld decline rates. ► As oil demand growth decelerates and the energy transition accelerates, investment shifts away from expensive, large- scale, single-project investments toward tight oil and smaller- scale projects that have faster payback periods. ► Small- or medium-scale onshore and subsea tieback projects, and those with multiphase expansion opportunities, are expected to account for most new-source conventional production over the outlook time horizon. ► The most expensive global areas for exploration face severe challenges. High-cost production in certain regions actually declines. ► By the 2030s we assume that Russia's relationship with the West improves, allowing more oil to \u0000ow to Europe, but the loss of foreign investment and access to international capital and technology is expected to prevent Russian production from recovering over the long term. The wider OPEC+ group (Vienna Alliance) may account for the majority of world oil output during the latter part of the outlook period. This, in turn, indicates the potential for strong continued or even increased OPEC+ in\u0000uence in global oil markets. But key wildcards include the future evolution of the group's membership (see Table 1.3 OPEC+ voluntary production quotas, as of July 2023). At the same time, the Eurasian members of the Vienna Alliance (Russia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan) are each expected to register a decline in oil output during outlook period, suggesting that net production by non-OPEC members of the Vienna Alliance may fall overall even as the OPEC members of OPEC+ increase their output (the Eurasian share of crude oil production among non-OPEC members of the alliance recently amounted to over 85%). In the base case, total OPEC liquids drilling rigs…and the availability of water resources for use in hydraulic fracturing.”¹⁸ More broadly, another key lesson of the US tight oil revolution for Kazakhstan is that conventional plays may also hold large- scale untapped tight oil reserves, which can, in turn, serve as a basis for redevelopment of many mature \u0000elds through much of the same technology (e.g., horizontal drilling in combination with multi-stage hydraulic fracturing). The possibilities for application of tight oil production technologies to mature \u0000elds nevertheless remain unexplored for the most part in Russia, where a shale oil development is most advanced within Eurasia. Russia's response to the North American tight oil phenomenon has consisted largely of an exploration of possible Russian analogs in new \u0000elds and plays instead of older conventional ones, with mixed results .¹⁹ 18 Ibid., p. 3. 19 For a comparison of the initial periods of tight oil development in the United States and Russia, see the S&P Global Private Report, Tight Oil in Russia: Can development spur a West Siberian renaissance? , July 2012. Starting in 2014, Western sanctions eﬀectively derailed a number of promising shale oil joint ventures between Russian companies and IOCs, but this is only part of the explanation for why Russia’s immense tight oil potential (e.g., the Bazhenov Formation underlying much of the West Siberian Basin) remains mostly unrealized. The absence inRussia of the aforementioned above-ground ingredients for a tight oil revolution is perhaps an even greater constraint. 26 GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND ENERGY MARKET DYNAMICS, 2022–23 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK production grows from 34.5 million b/d in 2022 to around 44 million b/d in 2050 for an increase of 28%, while OPEC's share of global liquids output during the same period increases from around 34% to 44%. In contrast, the oil production by the Eurasian members of OPEC+ is expected to fall from 13.2 million b/d in 2022 to roughly 10 million b/d in 2050, declining by 24% altogether, while the Eurasian share of global output drops from 13% to 10%.²⁰Table 1.3 OPEC+ voluntary production quotas, as of July 2023 (million b/d) Quota OPEC 0.96 1.46 0.31 0.12 0.17 4.22 2.55 1.74 8.98 2.88 23.38 Algeria Angola Congo Equatorial Guinea Gabon Iraq Kuwait Nigeria Saudi Arabia UAE Total OPECQuota Non-OPEC 0.68 0.20 0.10 1.55 0.57 0.80 10.48 0.07 0.12 14.57 37.95 Azerbaija Bahrain Brunei Kazakhstan Malaysia Oman Russia Sudan South Sudan Total Non-OPEC Total OPEC+ Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights . © 2023 S&P Global . The three largest oil producers globally during the period out to 2050 remain the United States along with OPEC+ members Saudi Arabia and Russia. These three producers accounted between them for over 30% of global liquids supply in 2022. But quite diﬀerent dynamics are envisioned for each going forward: ► US oil production is projected to peak by the early 2030s and then decline during the remainder of the outlook period . Despite the general cooling oil price environment, we still expect prices will remain robust enough for oil companies to grow production while continuing to generate hefty volumes of free cash \u0000ow that will \u0000ow back to investors. In the base case, US average annual oil output rises from 11.9 million b/d in 2022 to a peak of about 15.1 million b/d in 2032—roughly 3 million b/d above the previous maximum achieved in 2019. But core inventory exhaustion creates an increasing drag on output by the early 2030s, resulting in declining output for the rest of the forecast horizon, to around 11 million b/d in 2050. ► Saudi Arabia produced at its highest sustained rate in history in 2022 and remains on a growth trajectory in our outlook . Saudi crude oil output (accounting for the vast majority of its total liquids production) amounted to 10.6 million b/d in 2022, and is expected to average well over 10 million b/d for the rest"}

In our long-term outlook, Saudi Arabia's ability to sustainably increase output increases sharply beyond 2030, despite the peaking of global crude demand. By the following decade, non-OPEC (and some OPEC) supply will be in decline, requiring increases in Saudi output to meet the overall world call on crude. Redevelopments and enhanced oil recovery projects will drive new source growth in the country, and by 2050 national crude oil output is expected to amount to around 13 million b/d. ► Russia's war in Ukraine has set its upstream on a path of long-term decline. Russia's crude oil and condensate output rose slightly to 10.7 million b/d in 2022. We expect Russian oil production to decline during subsequent years of the outlook period. Our forecast envisions fewer new projects proceed- ing than in our previous outlooks. As a result, Russia's aggregate output is not able to oﬀset ongoing (and inevitable) declines in older \u0000elds even through 2030 as anticipated previously. Russian production is expected to decline by about 500,000 b/d from 2025 through 2030 and plateau in 2030–35 at about 8.5 million b/d as new projects oﬀset most of the declines from older producing \u0000elds. Decline rates in the short term are thawed by the ongoing robust expansion of condensate supply, but national liquids output dwindles to only around 8 million b/d by 2050 in the base case. 1.4.3 Implications for Kazakhstan These world oil price and supply-demand dynamics are taken as a general indicator of many global commodities, with key implica- tions for the economies of major commodity exporters such as Kazakhstan. For example, there is likely to a high, sustained global demand for the many critical minerals of the energy transition, such as copper, lithium, cobalt, and manganese, while demand for others, such as coal, declines. But throughout the period of Kazakhstan's independence, hydrocarbon resources have been an important factor and contributor to Kazakhstan's economy. Revenues from hydrocar- bon exports (crude oil, condensate, r e\u0000ned products, natural gas) have increased manyfold since 2000 and account for well over half of the country's total export earnings (e.g., $50.7 billion out of $84.4 billion, or 60.0% in 2022), as well as a large percentage of total budget revenues and foreign direct investment. Overall, the development of the national oil and gas industry has served Kazakhstan well, generating vital revenues and bringing in new 20 The corresponding numbers for the individual Eurasian members of OPEC+ in our base case are as follows: Russian oil production falls from around 10.7 to 7.9 million b/d (-26%); Kazakh output drops from 1.8 to 1.5 million b/d (-15%); Azeri volumes decrease from 0.7 to 0.6 million b/d (-17%) . 27 GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND ENERGY MARKET DYNAMICS, 2022–23 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK technologies and activities that have solidi\u0000ed the country's economic independence and delivered higher living standards. The extraction of hydrocarbon resources will remain an important element of Kazakhstan's economy for the foreseeable future, as the country will remain a signi\u0000cant global oil producer. But the heightened role of the hydrocarbon sector in Kazakhstan since the turn of the century also spells increased sensitivity of national macroeconomic dynamics to global oil markets and prices—which can make the diﬀerence between government budget surpluses or de\u0000cits, and the pr o\u0000tability or not of upstream investment. 1.4.3.1 Kazakhstan's economy: Oil price changes played key role in 2020- 23 “roller coaster” ride Kazakh GDP trends during 2020-23 illustrate the positive contribution of world oil price trends to Kazakhstan's economic performance as well as the downside risks (see Figure 1.10 Kazakhstan's real annual GDP growth, 2000-22, and Figure 1.11 Kazakhstan's quarterly GDP change, 2019-23): ► 2020-21: GDP contraction and then rebound with declining and then rising world oil prices . In 2020, GDP fell by 2.5% (the deepest recession for Kazakhstan in two decades) as a result of depressed external demand and lower prices for Kazakhstan's hydrocarbon exports owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. These eﬀects were compounded by the negative impact of lockdowns on domestic economic activity. But in 2021 Kazakhstan's economy recovered. A rebound in oil prices and rising external and domestic demand due to improvement in the epidemiological situation were accompa- nied by a rapid acceleration of Kazakhstan's quarterly GDP growth: from -1.2% in Q1 2021 to 6.5% in Q2, followed by a rise of 6.2% in Q3 and 5.9% in Q4. GDP increased by 4.3% overall in 2021, restoring pre-pandemic levels of economic activity.► 2022-23: GDP growth continued, but at a slower rate, reecting the new geopolitical headwinds as well as less oil price growth in 2022 and price decline in 2023 . The onset of the Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022, and ensuing Western sanctions on Russia (and Belarus, both of which like Kazakhstan are members of the Eurasian Economic Union) initially cast a pall over Kazakhstan's economic recovery, notwithstanding the positive oil price dynamic during much of 2022: Q1 GDP growth in 2022 already had begun to cool from the previous quarter, to 4.7%, and slowed further in Q2 to 2.8%, while the results for Q3 and Q4 were 2.0% and 3.7% growth, respectively, resulting in an annual 2022 GDP rise of 3.3%—somewhat lower than previous, pre-war forecasts in the 3.9%–4.0% range. S&P Global projects 2023 Kazakh GDP growth at around 3.7%, although \u0000rst half growth was about 5%.²¹ 21 In addition to the impacts of the war and sanctions on nearby states and major trading partners, civil unrest in Kazakhstan in early January 2022, sparked by public dissatisfaction with higher fuel prices, led to the declaration of martial law and the dispatch of Russian peacekeepers under the auspices of the Collective Security Treaty Organization to quell looting and episodic violence in Almaty, Astana, and other urban centers. The overall security situation then stabilized, while policy directions announced by President Kassym-Zhomart T okayev in the aftermath of the unrest had the eﬀect of slowing the pace of energy price hikes.

The following key Kazakh supply- and demand-side trends underlie GDP dynamics: ► Supply side: energy sector recovery continues to lift the national economy . The single largest component of the economy, comprising 29.6% of 2022 GDP, is the export- oriented industrial sector, which encompasses the mining and quarrying (extractive) sector of the economy including energy (see Figure 1.12 Kazakhstan's GDP in 2022 by sector). Industrial output jumped by 22.5% in 2022 in tenge terms, and this represented the sharpest increase of any major segment aside from agriculture (+25.9%). The energy sector remains a primary driver of the Kazakh economy, considering both shares in total industrial production and GDP overall, while oil accounts for the bulk of Kazakh export earnings and is the main source of the government's budgetary revenue. The oil and gas industries alone, together with related sectors (e.g., oil and gas transportation, upstream construction, and geology) probably contributed about 20% of the country's GDP directly in 2022, compared with 19.4% in 2021 (see Figure 1.13 Kazakhstan's oil and gas industry contribution to GDP). Meanwhile, combined revenue from crude oil and r e\u0000ned product exports jumped by 51.1% in 2022 to $48.4 billion—surpassing the 2019 level even though physical export volumes still remained somewhat lower (see Figure 1.14 Kazakhstan's oil export volumes and revenues ). Such heavy reliance of the national economy on the hydrocarbon sector means that global trends, such as commodity price \u0000uctuations, had a broad eﬀect in Kazakhstan, both directly and indirectly, impacting the performance of other sectors, including transportation, construction, retail trade, and professional services. ²² ► Demand side: the energy sector has lagged various other sectors in the post-2020 rebound for investment in xed capital, indicative of relatively weak returns. Following the 2020 drop, total investment in \u0000xed capital—i.e., investment in durable ( \u0000xed) assets such as buildings, machinery, and equipment, or other infrastructure or structur es that a \u0000rm holds for at least one year—recovered by 2022 to nearly the 2019 level or surpassed this level depending on the type of measurement (see Figure 1.15 Kazakh energy sector \u0000xed asset investment by segment in current dollars and Figure 1.16 Kazakh energy sector \u0000xed asset investment by segment in constant (2010) tenge). In current dollar terms, for example, total investment in \u0000xed assets rose by 13.4% in 2021 and by another 6.4% in 2022, to a total of $29.7 billion last year—only 1.6% lower than 2019. The growth spurt has been even greater measured in constant (2010) tenge terms; although such tenge-denominated investment declined by 4.1% in 2021, a 2022 surge of 33.6% more than erased the 2020-21 drop, and left this investment 9.9% higher than in 2019. Not surprisingly, the share of the energy sector in \u0000xed capital investment has been on the rise since 2020, when this share collapsed from 52.7% to 32.4%, but in 2022 the energy sector's share had only recovered to 34.0%. The post-2020 investment boom has occurred mainly outside of the energy sector; aggregate investment in \u0000xed assets in non-energy sectors actually remained on a growth trajectory in 2020, and by 2022 was already 37.1% higher than in 2019 in current dollar terms (53.2% higher in constant 2010 tenge). In contrast, energy sector \u0000xed capital investment collapsed by over 49.8% in 2020 in current dollar terms (by 47.1% in constant 2010 tenge), and in 2022 was still 36.4% below the 2019 level in current dollars (29.0% lower in constant 2010 tenge), though such investment is now well above the 2020 level.²³ 22 The distinction between the energ y-speci\u0000c segments of the economy and other sectors is not always clear-cut. Much service sector activity, for example, is closely interrelated with energy industry dynamics, as mobility (transporta- tion) is normally entailed in accessing goods and services. 23 Private consumption in Kazakhstan, the single largest segment of domestic demand, rose by 8.4% in dollar terms in 2022, to $110.4 billion. 29 Figure 1.12 Kazakhstan's GDP in 2022 by sector (% of total) Figure 1.13 Kazakhstan's oil and gas industry contribution to GDP ( % of GDP )Industry 29.6% 5.3% 5.2% 16.6%6.4%6.2%3.3%20.3%7.2% 102.9 trillion tenge Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights, Bureau of National Statistics RK. © 2023 S&P Global.0 5 10 15 20 2520152016201720182019202020212022Tertiary sector Secondary sectorPrimary sectorOil and gas production and related services Oil re\u0000ning Pipelines constructionTrading of oil, gas, products Transportation of oil, gas, products Exploration servicesGLOBAL ECONOMIC AND ENERGY MARKET DYNAMICS, 2022–23 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK Figure 1.14 Kazakhstan's oil export volumes and revenues (2014-22 ) Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights, Bureau of National Statistics RK (for export revenue). © 2023 S&P Global.0102030405060 020406080 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022MMt Billion $ Re\u0000ned product export volumes Crude oil export volumes Re\u0000ned product export revenue (right axis) Crude oil export revenue (right axis)Construction Agriculture* Wholesale and retail trade** Real Estate Transportation & storage"}

T o sum up our outlook for Kazakhstan's national economy's longer-term growth prospects, the base case is for real GDP to expand at a good pace, although slowing over time; this is at an annual rate averaging 2.6% during 2023-50. Deceleration is partly a natural consequence of the economy becoming larger over time: after averaging 3.1% during 2023-30 in the outlook, annual GDP growth slows to an average of 2.5% over 2031-40, and then 2.2% during 2041-50 (see Figure1.17 Kazakhstan's GDP growth rate: historical and outlook to 2050) 1.4.3.2 Kazakhstan's upstream develop- ment: Cost trends heighten urgency of policy reforms to attract new investment S&P Global's comparative analysis of upstream costs in oil- producing countries, for typical projects that will be launched over the next few years, indicates that Kazakhstan (and other Eurasian producers) may struggle to remain competitive with their international counterparts and retain (let alone grow) their global market share. Our latest comparison of full-cycle upstream project costs, for 2022, indicates that Eurasia had the highest regional average of typical project break-even costs at $66.35/bbl. The S&P Global cost curve methodology calculates a break-even price for a typical new Kazakhstan project in 2022 at about $67/bbl, although there is a considerable range around this central point; i.e., from a low of $36/bbl to a high of $99/bbl. This midpoint for Kazakhstan generally places the country on the right-hand side (higher-cost end) of the global cost curve, and the high variability indicates that a sizable proportion of Kazakhstan's potential incremental production is exceptionally costly (see Figure 1.18 Full-cycle costs in terms of Dated Brent for selected oil-producing countries in 2022, and box “The S&P Global full-cycle cost calculation methodology for 'new' oil production”). Longer term, the outlook is for Kazakh oil to remain relatively high cost in comparative international terms; in 2040, for example, new Kazakh oil projects yielding oil that year are expected to break even at around $70/bbl (in 2022 dollars), whereas about 65% of the 30 million b/d of new global crude production by 2040 from areas covered in the forecast breaks even at $50/bbl or less. 32 GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND ENERGY MARKET DYNAMICS, 2022–23 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK Figure 1.18 Full-cycle costs in terms of Dated Brent for selected oil-producing countries in 2022 ($/b bl) Notes: UAE = United Arab Emirates; assumes a 20% rate of return.

T o facilitate an equivalent comparison between regions, S&P Global Commodity Insights generated the oil price required for a 20% IRR for each of the projects. This is the “break-even price” for the relevant market. The price diﬀerential between the typical crude production from that market and the Brent oil price is added to this break-even price. The data was run using the S&P Global Commodity Insights QUE$TOR software, as well as the Energy and Climate Scenarios second- half 2022 data set. At the same time, there are some limitations of the break-even cost analysis impeding a country-by-country comparison of all potential cost components; e.g., the break-even numbers do not calculate \u0000scal breakeven (cost per barrel necessary to provide all government services). They also do not include transportation to market or export duties. ²⁴The S&P Global full-cycle cost calculation methodol- ogy for “new” oil production The S&P Global full-cycle cost calculation captures costs at the wellhead, including opex, capex, and upstream taxation; i.e., the cost of \u0000nding, developing, and then producing “new” oil production capacity. Our proprietary methodology shows these as “break-even” costs at the country level in aggregate, but actually involves analysis of individual upstream develop- ment projects within each country's portfolio; hence, they are shown as a range. This is essentially a forward-looking analysis, to understand the cost of developing new supply and allows us to highlight areas where new project development is viable at current (or expected) oil prices. Reservoir data and produc- tion pr o\u0000les are estimated, and drawn from the S&P Global database, and the terms are adjusted"}

The average (per country and/or geographical area) shown is not a weighted or arithmetic average but a selection of what a typical new oil project in that country or area (onshore/oﬀshore) would cost in current conditions. More speci\u0000cally, the \u0000elds selected for analysis represent the typical projects that will begin development over the next few years, and the cost calculation covers full-cycle break-even costs including exploration, extraction, operation, govern- ment take, and \u0000nal decommissioning. An estimate was prepared for each \u0000eld and the risk premium calculated by market. The risk premium was calculated by incorporating all the risk factors—including political, economic, legal, tax, operational, and security risks—that could aﬀect each project. The methodology to calculate break-even costs is provided through the following steps: ► Determine the cost of exploration, including appraisal wells. ► Add the cost of development, including any relevant risk premiums. ► Add the cost of operations. ► Apply a \u0000scal model to determine the oil price required for an acceptable internal rate of return (IRR) and highlight areas where project development is viable at current oil prices.24 For additional detail, see S&P Global Commodity Insights, Strategic Report, Cost of Oil Report: 2022, April 2023. 33 Kazakhstan continues to suﬀer largely from a low \u0000scal component in the overall rating; its \u0000scal ratings score r e\u0000ects relatively poor results in the categories of pr o\u0000t/investment ratio, state and government take, and investor cash \u0000ow (for additional background on the S&P Global \u0000scal systems ratings and other methodological issues, see the text box “The S&P Global E&P attractiveness ratings methodology”). Speci\u0000cally, in the third thquarter of 2023 Kazakhstan ranked only 95 in terms of \u0000scal systems rating among the same 112 oil-producing countries selected for the overall E&P attractiveness ranking. As discussed in Chapter 5 in more detail, potential policy shifts that could signi\u0000cantly improve Kazakhstan's E&P attractiveness rating include additional \u0000scal incentives for harder-to-recover oil, greater \u0000exibility in terms of domestic content requirements, and further Kazakh oil market price reforms needed to ensure that domestic deliveries of crude oil and r e\u0000ned products are as pro\u0000table as exports.GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND ENERGY MARKET DYNAMICS, 2022–23 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK Perceptions of above-ground risk factors in host countries also factor heavily into the E&P investment decisions of international players, and more enlightened policies by Kazakh state authorities could go far to enhance the country's ability to compete for the limited global capital available to \u0000nance upstream activity going forward. Kazakhstan has typically underperformed vis-à-vis most other oil-producing countries selected for analysis in a quarterly rating of E&P attractiveness that was developed by the S&P Global Petroleum Economics and Policy Solutions (PEPS) team. Kazakhstan's overall score in the PEPS ranking is comprised of a blend of scores representing legal and contractual terms, \u0000scal systems, and overall oil and gas risk. Since The National Energy Report 2021 —speci\u0000cally, starting in January 2023—our E&P attractiveness ratings default weights have been changed to an “Above-Ground Focus” weight pr o\u0000le in order to better r e\u0000ect the PEPS service's focus on above-ground factors that aﬀect a country's E&P investment environment—while we continue to provide ratings based on the legacy weights that consider a broader range of variables. Over time Kazakhstan has improved its standing in terms of both the rating that focuses on above- ground factors and the rating based on legacy weights, but the country's score nevertheless remains relatively low compared with that of other leading (or comparator) oil-producing countries.²⁵ This can be seen, for example, from a review of changes in Kazakhstan's rating each year during the same quarter of the last ten years, insofar as the PEPS scores are relatively comparable from year to year over 2014-23. For example, with respect to the above-ground focused ratings during the third quarter of each year, during this ten-year period Kazakhstan's rating on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being most attractive) improved from 4.91 to 5.39, while its rank among around 110 oil- producing countries selected for analysis (with 1 being most attractive) improved from 89 to 78 (see Table 1.4 Evolution of Kazakhstan's E&P Attractiveness rating and rank, 2014-23; Figure 1.19 S&P Global's E&P attractiveness ratings of selected oil- producing countries for Q3 2023: Above-Ground Focus weight pro\u0000le). Kazakhstan's ranking among countries in a general peer group cannot be readily compared over such an extended period of time since the S&P Global analysis has shifted the composition of this group markedly over the years. S&P Global currently ranks thKazakhstan at 7 place out of 8 nations in what is called the “petrostate” peer group (see Figure 1.20 Kazakhstan peer group E&P attractiveness ratings for Q3 2023: Above-Ground Focus weight pr o\u0000le). S&P Global de\u0000nes petrostates as countries where the production of oil and gas is a major source of economic activity , \u0000scal revenues, and exports; critically, exports of oil and gas by such nations have exceeded 20% of total exports over the last \u0000ve years.²⁶ 25 It should be noted that the periodic r e\u0000nement of the PEPS methodology for E&P attractiveness ratings and rankings complicates analysis of the evolution of any country's score over an extended period of time; e.g., changes in the number of indicators taken into consideration, and changes in a country's designated peer group. With this caveat in mind, it is nevertheless instructive to review Kazakhstan's progress during the period 2014-23, when the key indicators selected for analysis are relatively consistent over the years compared with earlier periods. 26 For more detailed comparative analysis of dynamics within this and other peer groups, see S&P Global Commodity Insights, Strategic Report, Oil & Gas Risk Quarterly: In the Balance—Pressures on E&P Terms, May 2023. 34 Notes: Ratings and rankings for the third quarter of each year.

EPAR is composed of 60+ variables relating to three core above-ground elements that aﬀect the value of upstream investments. 1. The Legal and Contractual Terms Attractiveness component of the EPAR includes the following six categories: ► Regulatory and Institutional Framework ► T erms for Entering / Acquisition of E&P Rights ► Contractual and Licensing Framework ► Commercial and Operational Requirements ► Contract Variations and Exit T erms ► Key Environmental Provisions 2. The Fiscal Attractiveness component of the EPAR includes the following eight categories: ► Undiscounted State Take²⁷ ► Undiscounted Government Take²⁸ ► Investor Cash Flow (US$/bbl) ► Investor Cash Flow (US$ million) ► Investor Internal Rate of Return (IRR, %) ► Investor Net Present Value (NPV) @ 12.5% (US$/bbl) ► Investor NPV @ 12.5% (US$ million) ► Investor Pr o\u0000t/Investment (P/I) Ratio 3. The Oil and Gas Risk component of the EPAR includes the following categories: ► Politics, with sub-categories of State Capacity, Political Legitimacy, Political Violence, Geopolitical Risk ► Economics, with sub-categories of Non-Payment Risk, Primary Fiscal Balance, Real Per Capita GDP Growth, Level of Development ► Hydrocarbon Sector Entry, with sub-categories of International Openness, Government Take, Expeditiousness of Contract, State/NOC Role ► Hydrocarbon Sector Operations, with sub-categories of Sanctity of Contract, Regulatory Burden, Civil Society Risk, Corruption, Rule of Law 29 For additional detail, see S&P Global Commodity Insights, Methodology, EPTAGR E&P Attractiveness Ratings Methodology, August 2023.27 State Take is the percentage of the Gross Project operating pr o\u0000t that accrues to the Government by way of royalties, production sharing (where applicable) and taxes paid by the investor(s), plus the operating pr o\u0000t attributable to the state's direct participation in a project; e.g., in the form of an NOC. 28 Government Take is the percentage of the Gross Project operating pr o\u0000t that accrues to the Government by way of royalties, production sharing (where applicable) and taxes paid by the investor(s). Government Take is similar to State Take but it excludes any cash \u0000ow attributable to the direct \u0000nancial participation in a project by the state or NOC.► Hydrocarbon Sector Shocks, with sub-categories of Market Access, Facility and Personnel Violence, Ministerial/Policy Volatility, Labor Unrest Each variable is assigned a rating ranging from 1 to 10 (where 1 represents the least attractive and 10 the most attractive from the investor's perspective). The scores for each variable are then weighted to calculate the overall E&P attractiveness score for each country. While the model encompasses some aspects that can be quanti\u0000ed, many of the risk scores accorded to the countries covered in the model are based on qualitative judgements.²⁹GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND ENERGY MARKET DYNAMICS, 2022–23 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK 1.5 High-Level Takeaways S&P Global draws the following key conclusions and implications for Kazakhstan from the research presented above: ► World oil prices: The higher average long-term world oil price now expected, compared with our previous outlook, underscores the criticality of Kazakh and other oil supplies to meet global demand throughout the outlook period, though the main beneciaries are probably lower-cost producers . Oil producers in Kazakhstan (as elsewhere) are subject to much the same set of key factors underlying the ratcheting up of the price outlook since 2021 in our long-term base case, and some of these factors may be even more acute in Kazakhstan's case compared with that of most other oil- producing nations; e.g., Kazakhstan may be exceptionally vulnerable to the new in\u0000ationary pressures related to supply chain issues, given the extra logistical challenges associated with the country's landlocked status and distance from major international oil\u0000eld equipment and service supply centers. The higher price assumed in our current base tends to increase the longevity of already-producing Kazakh \u0000elds, but most of the prospective new upstream projects in Kazakhstan may well remain “out of the money,” and Kazakhstan is likely to lose export market share in the longer term to lower-cost producers, concentrated largely in the Middle East. ► Global oil market structure: The strong partitioning of the global market due to Western sanctions may open up some new niches in Russia's former European markets for Kazakhstan (as well as other producers), but this upside is largely oﬀset by the intensied competition from Russian barrels in the more dynamic “East of Suez” markets, and new sanctions-related downside risks for third parties . Although Western"}

European oil demand had already entered a long-term decline trajectory well before 2022 and the dramatic escalation of the armed con\u0000ict in Ukraine, while the Asia P aci\u0000c markets to which Russia has redirected the bulk of its exports following 36 GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND ENERGY MARKET DYNAMICS, 2022–23 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK sanctions are among the chief centers of global oil consump- tion growth (longer term, as sanctions impinge on production levels, Russia will be hard-pressed to sustain exports to these markets at current levels). Kazakhstan has so far eﬀectively neutralized much (if not all) of the negative knock-on eﬀects from the war in Ukraine on its oil exports; e.g., by KEBCO rebranding. But Western sanctions will continue to pose risks for Kazakh oil industry players during much (if not all) of the outlook period along diﬀerent segments of the value chain—limiting the scope for partnerships with Russian companies and heightening risks associated with transit of exports via Russian territory. ► Supply fundamentals: OPEC+ continues to play a key market balancing role, but the opportunity costs associated with increased cuts may grow for Kazakhstan in the near as well as longer term . As a member of the sub-group of OPEC+ member nations committing in the \u0000rst half of 2023 to additional output cuts, through the end of 2024, Kazakhstan has carved out a more signi\u0000cant role for itself within the Vienna Alliance. But Kazakhstan's ability to execute on promised cuts is likely to become even more challenging than before, with the onset of the T engiz project expansion now expected by the end of 2024—potentially leaving Kazakh policymakers with the diﬃcult choice of falling short in terms of compliance with planned production cuts, or sacri\u0000cing national growth opportunities. Following the expected onset of national oil output decline after the 2020s (in our base case), Kazakhstan may be able to comply with any announced cuts more easily, but it is debatable whether national interests would not be better served by maximizing production and exports in order to boost monetization of remaining hydrocarbon resources while possible. ► Investment attractiveness: Kazakhstan must undertake more far-reaching policy reforms in order to compete eﬀectively for scarce global capital resources available to fund future upstream development. S&P Global's periodic comparative analysis of global upstream costs and country rankings in terms of E&P attractiveness both underscore the obstacles that Kazakhstan faces amid its bid to attract new sources of foreign investment. There is relatively little that Kazakh authorities can do to address some of the factors contributing to the country's consistent placement towards the high end of the global supply costs curve for new projects, insofar as these costs are rooted largely in geological and geographical realities, but there is still much room for \u0000scal and other policy improvements designed to address above- ground obstacles to upstream development that could signi\u0000cantly boost the country's appeal among would-be investors. 37 KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 2. KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 2.1 Key Points ► The ongoing energy transition (that is shifting consumption from fossil fuels, particularly hydrocarbons, to cleaner renewable types of energy) will be an extremely challenging, multidecadal process that will require extraordinary changes in energy use, technology, and policy. The inherent uncertainties involved in the overall energy transition process are now compounded by additional challenges—from geopolitical turbulence—that have disrupted and subsequently reoriented world energy \u0000ows following the February 2022 escalation of Russia's armed con\u0000ict with Ukraine. Concerns about reliable access to energy in adequate quantities and at aﬀordable prices have now put energy security at the forefront of most countries' national energy strategies, including Kazakhstan's. ► A very common energy security strategy involves eﬀorts by countries that rely on imports of major energy commodities (particularly oil and natural gas) to source these imports from a wide variety of suppliers, or at least to avoid heavy dependence on a single source. Good examples of such div ersi\u0000cation strategies are those deployed by mainland China with respect to oil and natural gas, the European Union (EU) for oil and gas, and the United States with respect to clean-energy minerals. Diversi\u0000cation of markets and export delivery routes also is an important energy security issue for energy exporters, especially now for Eurasian countries such as Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan. ► Another important dimension of energy security, resilience, entails the ability to recover eﬀectively and relatively quickly from unexpected events and disruptions. Three components of resilience that are critical in the response of energy systems to unforeseen geopolitical events, natural disasters, and economic shocks are: storage of hydrocarbon fuels, reliability of the electrical grid, and political (policy) resilience (public support built through transparency and equitable access to aﬀordable energy). Hydrocarbon fuel storage capacity oﬀers \u0000exibility and protection against unanticipated supply disruptions for consumers and demand \u0000uctuations or transport diﬃculties for producers. Increasing power grid reliability, always essential for consumers, now is needed to accommodate both greater electri\u0000cation and the larger share of intermittent renewable generation entering the grid to support decarbonization eﬀorts. A good example of the interconnectedness of electric power reliability and hydrocarbons in Kazakhstan can be found in the consequences of a brief power supply outage in western Kazakhstan in early July 2023, which disrupted upstream oil and gas production, brie\u0000y shuttered a r e\u0000nery, and interrupted crude export \u0000ows on pipelines. ► A much-debated question in the current environment of A renewed focus on energy security, both regionally and globally, as armed con\u0000ict, economic sanctions, and reorientation of global trade patterns disrupt the international order, global supply chains, and global energy systemsdisrupted and reoriented global supply chains is whether the new “energy insecurity” will delay or (conversely) accelerate the pace of the energy transition. Many signs now point toward energy security concerns accelerating the energy transition.

Global capex on wind and solar projects grew from $357 billion in 2021 to $490 billion in 2022, surpassing investment in oil and gas development for the \u0000rst time. However, these drivers are not entirely unidirectional, as in some obvious ways energy security concerns are acting as a brake on the transition in some parts of the world. A prime example is the pushback from developing countries (especially in Africa) over the resistance of developed country institutions to support natural gas expansion, which is much less emissions-intensive than the traditional fuels that are being displaced. ► The Paris Climate Agreement also laid out a framework for the development of extraterritorial emission reduction schemes or mechanisms. One example is the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which went into eﬀect on 16 May 2023. CBAM will impose a fee, starting in 2026, on imports of selected products into the EU commensurate with the degree to which greenhouse gas emissions from the production of these products exceeds a speci\u0000ed norm (emissions from the 10% of EU companies in the same industry reporting the highest emissions per unit of output). The sectoral scope of CBAM has now expanded to include not only electric power, cement, fertilizers, aluminum, and iron-steel, but also hydrogen, ammonia, and downstream iron-steel products. The eﬀect on Kazakhstan would appear to be manageable, however, given that only $2.5 billion of these CBAM-related goods were exported to all countries in 2022 (not just EU members), representing only about 3% of the total value of Kazakhstan's overall exports; furthermore, the bulk of these goods were actually exported to neighboring countries, with very little going to the EU. ► One of the most important questions from a national security perspective involves the overall cost of the energy transition and its potential impacts on economic performance, jobs , wages, and vulnerable populations. Anxiety about the overall cost of the transition is a genuine concern and perhaps the single biggest obstacle to achieving political consensus on the implementation of a net-zero carbon strategy. An S&P Global assessment of the costs of the energy transition for a single developed country (achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in the United States in one particular pathway) yields several important insights that may be applicable more broadly : o The greatest costs are borne by energy consumers, of course, in the form of higher direct expenditures on electricity and more expensive low-carbon fuels. Consumer- level energy expenditures grow (in real terms) from about $1.3 trillion annually in the 2020s to $1.4 trillion–$1.5 trillion in the 2040s, or by 8-15%. For the US, this increase in consumer costs is viewed as manageable given relative income levels and expenditure patterns. 39 o But broader societal costs incurred from the transition are largely oﬀsetting. Among the direct societal costs, additional consumer outlays for durable goods (vehicles, appliances, etc.) increase, peaking at $174 billion in 2036, driven largely by the net purchase cost of electric vehicles. Other direct societal costs (i.e., the cost to taxpayers of government incentives and oﬀsets) increase to $179 billion in 2050, peaking at $233 billion in 2040. Investment outlays by businesses and industry also rise considerably. Oﬀsetting the increase in these direct societal costs, indirect costs (i.e., externalities based on environmental costs, such as human health) decline from $308 billion in 2023 to zero in 2050. Thus, when carbon externalities are included, society's annual net total costs actually decline 3% in 2050 relative to 2026. o Similarly, a net-zero power sector requires substantial additional electric power investment expenditure. Power sector infrastructure capex in the United States over the period 2023–50 is projected at $7.1 trillion, 85% higher than the $3.7 trillion projected in a “business as usual” scenario. When annualized, the additional electric power investment required under a 2050 net-zero scenario amounts to approximately $90 billion. ► Similarly, a future with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2060 in Kazakhstan is viewed as being both technically possible and economically feasible. However, achieving this goal will require deep structural changes throughout the entire economy—from power generation and industry, to buildings and the transport sector, to agriculture and land use, including a thorough and fundamental transformation of the energy sector. Carbon neutrality will require the mobilization of substantial investments over the entire period to 2060—an estimated $666.5 billion, or roughly triple Kazakhstan's total GDP of $223.5 billion in 2022. However, when annualized over the 40-year period (2021-60), for the most part it does not exceed historic investment to GDP ratios. But the investment does take place in entirely diﬀerent sectors and therefore is recouped from a diﬀerent set of consumers. ► Energy company transition strategies have been modied, but not wholly transformed by energy security concerns. The response of the business sector to the energy transition has been multi-faceted, subject to some mid-course adjustment. Many hydrocarbon producers expected that they would reach maximum oil and gas output earlier and at lower levels than forecasted prior to the pandemic, and pursued portfolio diversi\u0000cation, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), divestments, and new clean-energy ventures to address the energy transition. But energy security concerns stemming from rising prices and disrupted supply chains resulting from the con\u0000ict between Russia and Ukraine have caused many industry executives to reassess their business plans and approaches to the transition in general. In the current strong demand environment, some “ \u0000rst mover” companies in the energy transition have pushed back the timetable for reducing oil and gas production. Both European and North American majors have concentrated their activities closer to home geographically, in better known geologic and political environments, while exercising increased capital discipline. National oil companies, although a diverse group, generally have continued to focus on monetizing their hydrocarbon resources as eﬀectively as possible in an increasingly competitive investment environment.► For Kazakhstan, coal can provide an important “energy security blanket” during the transition.

Although a major drawback is its high carbon-intensity, as Kazakhstan shifts to cleaner fuels that are either imported (natural gas) or higher cost or dependent on imported technologies and equipment (solar, wind, hydrogen), low-cost indigenous coal (even as its use winds down) can serve as an important stabilizer or anchor in oﬀsetting the inherent risks posed by these other energy sources to availability and aﬀordability. And where coal consumption is necessary, a number of technologies can be employed during its extraction and combustion to reduce harmful emissions. ► Kazakhstan will remain a sizable net exporter of primary energy for the foreseeable future. Yet just as total primary energy exports as a share of primary energy production have declined in recent years (from 51.6% in 2020 to 48.2% in 2022), our primary energy balance projections show this trend continuing. The implication is that while energy exports will continue to play an important role in the country's economy, slowly declining energy production and rising domestic energy consumption reduce net primary energy exports substantially over the next 25 years or so, by roughly half (to 52.5 MMtoe) by 2050. 2.2 Introduction As noted in the \u0000rst chapter, world energy demand is again on an upward trajectory in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meeting this new demand while simultaneously transitioning from existing fossil-fuel-based capacity to lower-carbon forms of energy is an enormous challenge. All indications are that this will be a protracted, multidecadal process, involving extraordinary changes in energy use, technology, and policy. The uncertainties involved in the energy transition are now compounded by additional challenges from geopolitical turbulence that have disrupted and subsequently reoriented world energy \u0000ows following Russia's escalation of armed con\u0000ict with Ukraine, beginning in February 2022. Concerns about reliable access to energy in adequate quantities and at aﬀordable prices have now put the concept of energy security at the forefront of most countries' national energy strategies, including that of Kazakhstan. Yet energy security is a \u0000uid and multidimensional concept—meaning one thing for energy producers and another for importers—with complex interrelationships with and implications for the energy transition. We begin by outlining three major dimensions of energy security—div ersi\u0000cation, resilience, and transparency—before exploring the emerging impacts of energy security policies on the global energy transition.¹ 1 The discussion in this chapter is fundamentally informed by a number of sources, both within and outside S&P Global, the most important of which are: Daniel Yergin, The New Map: Energy, Climate, and the Clash of Nations . New York: Penguin Press, 2020; Daniel Yergin, Bumps in the Energy Transition , S&P Global, Energy Executive Commentary, 14 December 2022; and Jason Bordoﬀ and Meghan O'Sullivan, \"The Age of Energy Insecurity: How the Fight for Resources is Upending Global Geopolitics,\" Foreign Aﬀairs , May/June 2023 (published online 10 April 2023). KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 40 2.3 Three Major Dimensions of Energy Security 2.3.1 Diversication strategies 2.3.1.1 Diversication of supply for energy importers One of the more readily recognizable energy security strategies involves eﬀorts by countries that rely on imports of major energy commodities (particularly oil and natural gas) to source these imports from a wide variety of suppliers, or at least to avoid heavy dependence on a single source. China (for natural gas) A good example of such a div ersi\u0000cation strategy is that deployed by mainland China with respect to natural gas. Although China's domestic natural gas production over the period 2011–21 increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7%, gas demand growth over that same period was even faster (11%). Imports of natural gas in 2021 accounted for 45% of China's total demand of about 366 billion cubic meters (Bcm), up from 21% in 2011.² These imports are broadly div ersi\u0000ed, both in terms of the mode of delivery (pipelines vs. LNG shipped by tanker) and by source country. Although the mode of delivery varies signi\u0000cantly seasonally, LNG tends to account for between slightly more than half of total imports to as much as two-thirds for certain periods. LNG imports are sourced from a large number of countries, including Australia, Trinidad-Tobago, Nigeria, Indonesia, Oman, Qatar, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Peru, United States, Brunei, and Papua New Guinea. LNG is also procured with a diversity of contractual arrangements in terms of pricing and \u0000exibility. China receives pipeline gas imports from \u0000ve neighboring countries: Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan (all via the three strings of the Central Asia–China natural gas pipeline [CAGP] system), Russia, and Myanmar. Although imports via the CAGP accounted for 75% of total pipeline imports in 2021 (56% from Turkmenistan alone), the share of Russian imports (18%) is set to increase dramatically by 2025, when full contracted volumes via the Power of Siberia-1 pipeline (38 Bcm/y) would be about on par with expected Turkmen deliveries (33.1 Bcm in 2021).³ European Union (EU) (for oil and gas) Unlike mainland China, where gas supply div ersi\u0000cation r e\u0000ects a decades-long government policy, the EU shifted its sources of oil and gas supply rather suddenly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022. Prior to the invasion, Russia supplied roughly 40% of the EU's imported gas and 25% of its imported oil. Russia already had begun to curtail pipeline gas deliveries in late 2021, but in the months after armed con\u0000ict began and the explosion on the Nord Stream pipeline in the Baltic Sea in September 2022, Russia cut oﬀ gas deliveries entirely except to a few countries in Southern and Central Europe (e.g., Hungary, Greece, Serbia, Slovakia, Austria, Italy), with the result being a reduction in pipeline gas deliveries to the EU by about 80% in 2022.⁴ As a consequence, gas prices in Europe increased twelvefold and natural gas demand in the EU fell in 2022 by 55 Bcm, or 13%, its steepest drop in history.⁵ Thanks to this decline in demand, a large mandated build-up of"}

In addition to its sudden turn to LNG (and temporarily increased reliance on coal), the EU reinforced its long-term commitment to developing renewable forms of energy; renewable generation now provides nearly half (47%) of electric power production (although renewable equipment remains heavily dependent on international supply chains).⁶ Even prior, in 2021 EU policymakers were in the midst of heated debate over whether to list natural gas and nuclear power within its “Green Taxonomy” of energy projects that European \u0000nancial institutions could include within so-called “environmentally sustainable” or “green” investment (equity or debt) products.⁷ Proponents for inclusion argued in favor of gas and nuclear as an essential bridge in facilitating the transition away from even more environmentally harmful energy sources (coal, fuel oil) towards a mostly renewables-based future. Opponents of funding for new gas infrastructure argued that the standard operational lifetime of new gas infrastructure would exceed the timetable required to achieve carbon neutrality (2050), thus perpetuating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while opponents of nuclear cited the absence to date of a viable, safe, and long-term method of disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The dispute was resolved not soon after the onset of the armed con\u0000ict in Ukraine, and appears to re\u0000ect a realization that in the new geopolitical environment these sources will continue to be needed to meet medium-term energy demand on the Continent. On 9 March 2022, the European Commission adopted a Complementary Climate Delegated Act that included, under strict conditions, speci\u0000c nuclear and gas energy activities in the list of economic activities covered by the EU Green Taxonomy. The Act, which went into eﬀect on 1 January 2023, is a compromise of sorts that permits the following new gas and nuclear projects to qualify for funding as sustainable investments: ► Gas-\u0000red generation of electricity, co-generation of electricity and heat, and heating/cooling from eﬃcient district heating/cooling plants, providing that: \u0000 They replace an existing coal-\u0000red facility that cannot be replaced by renewables 2 The year 2021 is used here for comparative purposes as r e\u0000ecting a more \"normal\" year for Chinese gas demand than 2022, when COVID measures reduced Chinese gas demand by 1% and LNG imports fell by 21%. This was a result of extremely high spot prices, r e\u0000ecting a surge in European LNG demand following the onset of the Russia-Ukraine con\u0000ict. 3 S&P Global Commodity Insights, Regional Integrated, China Natural Gas Market Prole , February 2022, p. 34. 4 S&P Global Commodity Insights, Europe Gas: Volatile Market Movements Reect Short-Term Relief but Long-term Challenges Loom , Executive B rie\u0000ng, 10 May 2023. 5 https://www.iea.org/commentaries/europe-s-energy-crisis-what-factors- drove-the-record-fall-in-natural-gas-demand-in-2022. 6 S&P Global Commodity Insights, Regional Integrated Insight, Europe's Green Industrial Policy Revival , 5 June 2023. 7 The National Energy Report 2021 , pp. 47–49. KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 41 o They achieve certain targets in terms of emissions reductions o They fully switch to renewable or low-carbon gases (e.g., hydrogen, biomethane) by 2035 ► Research, development, and deployment of advanced Generation IV nuclear power generation technologies that minimize waste and improve safety standards ► New nuclear plant projects with existing Generation III+ technologies for energy generation of electricity or heat (approvals until 2045) ► Upgrades and modi\u0000cations of existing nuclear plants for lifetime extension purposes (approvals until 2040).⁸ United States (onshoring and “friend-shoring” of supply chains for critical minerals and renewable equipment) Another common strategy utilized by importing countries—in this case by the United States, a major importer of critical minerals and equipment used in the production of renewable energy—is to add “own production” as a source of supply, i.e., to move as much of the supply chain as possible to domestic sources. The In\u0000ation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted into law in late 2022, encourages the production of critical minerals in the United States and elsewhere by providing an estimated $386 billion in tax credits and loan guarantees for domestic producers of renewable energy and other clean-energy technologies over a 10-year period. ⁹ US policymakers believed that such a massive stimulus was necessary to prevent the country's overreliance on mainland China and other countries possessing much of the world's capacity for critical minerals (e.g., lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare metals) and manufacturing equipment (solar panels, wind turbine components) used in the energy transition. If anything, the geographic concentration of these critical inputs for renewable and clean-energy technologies is even greater than for fossil fuels. T o take just the example of the electric vehicle (EV) battery supply chain: the world's largest supplier of lithium—a major EV battery mineral—is Australia, which accounts for 53% of global supply. The processing and r e\u0000ning of EV battery minerals are even more concentrated, with China currently performing around 60% of lithium and nickel r e\u0000ning and over 70% of cobalt re \u0000ning. Meanwhile, Chinese companies manufacture more than three-quarters of EV batteries and a similar proportion of the so-called wafers and cells used in solar energy technology.¹ ⁰ Such concentration of manufacturing capacity—while supporting technological advances as well as economies of scale—could also create vulnerabilities in the event of company insolvencies or other disruptions (such as port closures in 2021 and 2022 as a result of COVID-19), not to mention supplier embargoes on exports to states not deemed to be friendly (e.g., China's two-month suspension of exports of rare-earth minerals to Japan in 2010). When onshoring is not possible, “friend-shoring”—integration with “friendly” or “like-minded” countries to form integrated markets (for clean-energy materials) or reserves—is another strategy. It r e\u0000ects the belief that an interconnected global energy system can be an important pillar of energy security when integrated markets can eﬀectively allocate supplies to ease episodic disruptions in individual countries caused by extreme weather events or political instability.

In an international environment in which uranium enrichment capacity is limited in an eﬀort to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation, the Bank provides access to IAEA member states seeking emergency supplies of low- enriched uranium to fuel nuclear reactors. The Bank is capable of storing up to 90 tons of low-enriched uranium hexa\u0000uoride (UF₆) fuel.¹¹ These emerging forms of cooperation are still evolving and can take many forms. For example, the US State Department is pushing for the conclusion of a “minerals security partnership” with 13 other governments to promote investment in critical mineral supply chains.¹² The sharing of information on critical minerals and coordination of standards and strategies for clean energy investment were among the topics of discussion at the G7 meeting of major industrialized democracies in Hiroshima, Japan in May 2023. In addition to a multilateral format, the US government has concluded bilateral agreements with individual countries, such as in December 2022 with Zambia (the world's sixth-largest copper producer) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (which produces 70% of the world's cobalt) to increase US imports of these electric battery minerals.¹³ The US Export- Import Bank also is empowered to fund overseas mining operations in “friendly” countries such as Indonesia. Finally, some “friend-shoring” developments are the result of private-sector initiatives. The Australian companies Pilbara Minerals and Calix are working on a pilot project that will explore the feasibility of re\u0000ning in Australia of some of the lithium produced at the Pilbara mines, rather than sending it to China for processing. A \u0000nal investment decision is expected by end of 2023. Because Australia has a free trade agreement with the United States, the project (if approved) could qualify for IRA funding and could account for as much as 20% of global lithium r e\u0000ning capacity by 2027.¹⁴ 2.3.1.2 Diversication of markets and transport routes for energy exporting countries Energy security is no less salient for major energy exporters, as demonstrated by recent events, particularly for countries in the Eurasian region. Security is enhanced for energy producers by access to diverse markets through multiple reliable transportation routes. For Kazakhstan and Russia, the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union's single markets in oil/oil products and natural gas are expected to promote the security of their energy exports through the harmonization of standards and customs procedures across \u0000ve member states (see Chapter 3). 8 See https://ﬁnance.ec.europa.eu/sustainable-ﬁnance/tools-and- standards/eu-taxonomy-sustainable-activities_en , as well as S&P Global Commodity Insights, Regional Integrated Insight, Taxonomy -What's green in Europe's power market , March 2022. 9 Producers in other countries deemed to have \"free trade agreements\" with the United States also are considered to be eligible for the IRA subsidies. 10 Bordoﬀ and O'Sullivan, \"The Age of Energy Insecurity.\" 11 The National Energy Report 2021 , p. 218. 12 New York Times , 22 May 2023. 13 https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-releases-signed-memorandum-of- understanding-with-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-and-zambia-to- strengthen-electric-vehicle-battery-value-chain/. 14 New York Times , 26 May 2023. KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 42 Kazakhstan (oil) The imposition of additional energy-related sanctions by the EU and other countries on Russia, following the start of that country's armed con\u0000ict with Ukraine in February 2022, resulted in a strong eastward reorientation of Russian oil \u0000ows away from Europe and toward Asia. This has had far-reaching impacts on the perceived importance and reliability of Kazakhstan's crude oil exports, which move predominantly to Europe and which mostly transit Russia. The average monthly share of Kazakhstan's crude exports destined for European markets fell by 10 percentage points, from 73% of the total during the immediate pre-invasion period (April 2018–February 2022) to 63% during the period immediately following (March 2022–February 2023).¹⁵ The importance of transit via Russia for Kazakhstan's crude exports is illustrated by the fact that 64.3 million metric tons (MMt) of crude—roughly 94% percent of all exports—transited via Russia in 2022 according to the Kazakh Energy Ministry data; the lion's share of these transit volumes are exported via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline route while a signi\u0000cant portion is also carried by Transneft pipeline.¹⁶ Repeated problems on the CPC pipeline in the spring and summer 2022, mainly related to maintenance and other issues and to storm damage to two of three oﬀshore moorings at CPC's Yuzhnaya Ozereyevka terminal on the Black Sea (with each mooring shuttered for repair for at least a month), severely disrupted export capacity on occasion during the August–November period and increased Kazakh policymakers' apprehensions about its reliability and the wisdom of such heavy reliance on Russian transit. As a consequence, oﬃcials began pushing for more exports via other routes, and particularly westward across the Caspian Sea and via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline. Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR and KMG concluded an agreement in November 2022 to ship 1.5 MMt of Kazakh oil along BTC in 2023, with the view that perhaps twice this volume ultimately could be exported via this route without major upgrades. This agreement, together with some increases in exports on the Kazakhstan-China pipeline (KCP), have somewhat assuaged near-term concerns over the potential loss of access to export markets. However, long-term apprehension remains. Kazakh Energy Ministry oﬃcials believe the current capacity of all export routes other than CPC is only 16.5 MMt, or only about one quarter the volume of 2022 exports.¹⁷ Kazakh concerns about security are not limited to transit routes, but increasingly extend to sustaining oil production at present levels. KAZENERGY representatives recently sounded a warning that output from mature “legacy” \u0000elds in the country is now declining at a faster pace than reserves are being added elsewhere through exploration and new \u0000eld development. Because the output of these \u0000elds (owned by KMG, CNPC-Aktobemunaygaz, and numerous independents) is the supply source for the domestic market, there is increasing risk, as early as 2025, of a domestic shortage of legacy crude to meet domestic r e\u0000ned products demand."}

It presently has limited options, with most of its natural gas going to China, although Russia also remains important, although highly volatile in terms of sales volumes. Following the imposition of Western sanctions on Russia and the curtailment of Russian gas exports to Europe, Gazprom again chose to reduce imports from Turkmenistan, which fell by two-thirds in 2022.¹⁹ Gas exports to Iran (and to Azerbaijan via Iran) also have been an important div ersi\u0000cation option for Turkmenistan. On 30 May 2023, Iran's oil minister announced that a new contract for imports of 10 MMcm/d (3.65 Bcm/y) of Turkmen gas would allow deliveries to resume in June.²⁰ Russia (oil) A major energy exporter aﬀected even more directly by Western energy sanctions has been Russia itself, which essentially has been forced to reorient its oil trade eastward to Asia. The con\u0000ict with Ukraine has imposed steep costs on Russia, with the EU and other Western nations imposing bans on seaborne crude imports from Russia and r e\u0000ned products. For now, Russia has successfully redirected its crude exports, which grew by more than 12% overall in 2022, with India and China emerging as the major buyers. However, this comes with the use of more expensive long-distance waterborne hauls from western Russian ports.²¹ Product sales also appear to have held up reasonably well for now (down only 7.6% in 2022), \u0000nding markets in Asia, Turkey, Brazil, western Africa, and the Middle East. S&P Commodity Insights projects that Russia's r e\u0000nery throughput (about half of which historically is exported) will contract given the diﬃculties of maintaining product exports. ²² In short, an inability to fully compensate for the loss of large portions of the Western products markets may leave Russian r e\u0000ners little option but to curtail output. Russia (gas) Although not similarly legally banned, natural gas deliveries to Europe also have fallen dramatically, as Russia has refused to sell to many customers unwilling to switch to payment in rubles. The major challenge is where to redirect the approximately 90 Bcm of gas now no longer going to Europe. Europe formerly was by far Russia's largest export market, accounting for two-thirds of total 2021 exports (176.5 Bcm of 263.5 Bcm). As a consequence, Russia's overall gas exports fell by 30% in 2022, and will fall further in 2023.²³ 15 Kazakhstan Newsline , 13 April 2023; https://astanatimes.com/2023/04/expert- kazakhstan-can-increase-oil-supplies-to-asian-markets/. 16 Kazakhstan Newsline , 27 March 2023; https://www.zakon.kz/6385866-chto- nuzhno-predprinyat-kazakhstanu-dlya-div ersi\u0000katsii-postavki-nefti-rasskazala- ekspert.html. 17 Kazakhstan Newsline, 13 April 2023; https://astanatimes.com/2023/04/expert- kazakhstan-can-increase-oil-supplies-to-asian-markets/.

KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 43 A large portion of Russia's gas production is now eﬀectively stranded, as its LNG development is hampered by sanctions on imports of gas liquefaction equipment. China is widely viewed as the only market large enough to eventually take some of this stranded gas, although the build-out of infrastructure to support this reorientation, while now under way, will take a good number of years. Russia already is a strategic gas supplier for China, accounting for 10% (10.4 Bcm) of its gas imports in 2021 and 15.4 Bcm in 2022. The two countries' gas ties will strengthen further given the ramp-up of the 38 Bcm/y Power of Siberia-1 (POS-1) project, which is expected to reach contracted volumes in 2025, and the recently announced (February 2022) 10 Bcm/y Far East gas pipeline contract. Yet the conclusion of these agreements increases total contracted piped volumes between Russia and China to only 48 Bcm/y, just slightly more than half the decline in Russian piped gas exports to Europe that occurred in 2022. The big hope for the future is the 45–50 Bcm/y Power of Siberia-2 pipeline that will move gas from West Siberia to China, transiting Mongolia. No commercial agreement has yet been reached. Perhaps it is not surprising, in this context, and given Russia and China's prominent roles in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, that a recent “Statement by the Council of the Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on Energy Security” (Samarkand, Uzbekistan, 16 September 2022) emphasized the need to strengthen “interaction between the supplying countries, transit countries, and consumer countries to guarantee the security and stability of international channels of energy commodities transportation and to ensure the uninterrupted functioning of the global production and supply chain.”²⁴ Trilateral discussions (Kazakhstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan) on utilization and expansion of natural gas infrastructure in Central Asia One development that appears to hold some promise for improving energy security for Russia (by opening additional markets) as well as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (to secure additional supplies), is the ongoing discussion among the three countries to coordinate activities to upgrade natural gas infrastructure in order to support higher levels of intra-regional and international gas trade. The partnership aims to: ► deliver Russian natural gas to Uzbekistan using Kazakh transit; Uzbekistan agreed a gas supply contract with Gazprom to import 2.8 Bcm/y under a two-year deal, starting at 9 MMcm/day later this year using the Soviet-era Central Asia–Center pipeline system"}

The focus of this section is on three components of resilience that are critical in the response of energy systems to unforeseen geopolitical events, natural disasters, and economic shocks: storage of hydrocarbon fuels, reliability of the electrical grid, and political (policy) resilience (involving public support through transparency and equitable access to aﬀordable energy). 2.3.2.1 Storage Hydrocarbon fuel storage capacity oﬀers \u0000exibility and protection against unanticipated supply disruptions for consumers and demand \u0000uctuations or transport diﬃculties for producers. One of the more widely utilized safeguards against supply disruptions deployed internationally are strategic petroleum reserves. The International Energy Agency (IEA), an intergovernmental organization with 31 member countries founded in 1974 in the wake of the Arab Oil Embargo, maintains a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) program.²⁸ The goal of the program is to ensure there is adequate oil and r e\u0000ned products storage capacity to enable the participants to mitigate (and \u0000exibly respond to) market impacts driven by sudden changes in demand (of consumers for product and r e\u0000neries for crude) or unanticipated disruptions of crude and product imports or exports (due to upstream outages, accidents on pipelines and at ports, natural disasters, trade embargoes, etc.). In accordance with the Agreement on an International Energy Program (1974, amended in 2018), each net-importing IEA country is required to hold oil stocks (crude and product) equivalent to at least 90 days of net oil imports and be prepared to release emergency stocks to the market in response to a supply disruption (see Figure 2.1 SPRs of select member and associate IEA countries (February 2023)). The most recent emergency release of oil (120 million barrels [MMb] of crude and r e\u0000ned products) from member-country SPRs was announced on 1 April 2022 in an eﬀort to calm global markets as fuel supplies tightened after the start of the Russia-Ukraine con\u0000ict (Brent crude had spiked to as high as $130/b). One day earlier, the United States had announced that it would make available up to 180 MMb from its 24 http://eng.sectsco.org/documents/. 25 https://kz.kursiv.media/23-06-16/zhnb-qazaqgazgazpromuz/. 26 Another dimension in the discussions is a proposal by Kazakhstan to construct a new international gas pipeline from Russia that would run through Kazakh territory and connect to China, in the process delivering natural gas to Kazakhstan's eastern regions via the route Kostanay - Astana - Pavlodar - Semey - Ust-Kamenogorsk. 27 Energy Intelligence, Nefte Compass , 21 June 2023, p. 4. 28 During the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) imposed a crude oil embargo against the United States in retaliation for the US decision to re-supply the Israeli military and to gain leverage in the post-war peace negotiations. Arab OPEC members also extended the embargo to other countries that supported Israel, including the Netherlands, Portugal, and South Africa. The embargo both banned petroleum exports to the targeted nations and introduced cuts in oil production. The 1973 Oil Embargo acutely strained a US economy that had grown increasingly dependent on foreign oil. The onset of the embargo contributed to an upward spiral in US oil prices, with global implications. The price of Br ent crude \u0000rst doubled, then quadrupled, imposing skyrocketing costs on consumers and structural challenges to the stability of entire national economies. See https://history.state.gov/milestones /1969-1976/oil-embargo. KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 44 SPR over a six-month period. The IEA action represented the \u0000fth (and largest) emergency release in its 48-year history. IEA member countries have \u0000exibility in how they meet stockholding obligations: in the form of government stocks held exclusively for emergencies (typically crude), stocks held for commercial purposes (both crude and products) by r e\u0000ners and wholesalers, and stocks held in third countries under bilateral agreements. Some IEA members (Canada, Norway, Mexico, and the United States) are net exporters, and are not obligated to abide by the IEA reserve requirements. Nonetheless some, such as the US, maintain their own SPRs under lower reserve requirements. The capacity of the US SPR is 714 MMb (about 95.2 million metric tons [MMt]). As of 19 May 2023, it held 357.95 MMb (down by fully one-third year on year as a result of releases designed to lower domestic gasoline and diesel prices)—equal to 17.6 days of crude supply at average 2022 US consumption levels (20.28 million barrels per day [MMb/d]). Likewise, mainland China—now the world's largest oil importer as well as a major producer whose petroleum companies are active in many countries of the world—has its own approach to strategic petroleum storage. The IEA collaborates with China and certain other non-member countries (e.g., India, Indonesia, and Thailand) through its multilateral Association Agreement, which allows associate countries (currently there are 11) to participate in IEA meetings and work with IEA member-states on energy security, energy policy, data exchange, and technology matters. It also maintains less formal, bilateral cooperation agreements with other countries. China does not oﬃcially report its SPR volume, although it is believed to be more than 400 MMb with a capacity of 500 MMb. The state plan calls for reserves of 475.9 MMb, equal to about 30 days of supply at 2021 daily consumption levels (15.8 MMb/d). Disruptions of crude shipments via the CPC pipeline in 2022, the 2020 contraction in global oil demand from COVID-19, and Kazakhstan's current eﬀorts to redirect a higher share of its oil exports via the Caspian Sea highlight the importance of storage in supporting operational \u0000exibility.

And on 20 May 2022, Kazakhstan's Ministry of Energy announced plans to add 200,000 tons of re\u0000ned products to a new reserve of major fuel types created in Q1 2022, suﬃcient to meet nearly one month of projected demand. The new supplies will add to stocks already held by KazMunayGaz and Kazakhstan T emir Zholy, and are intended to protect against an emergency situation or an unexpected spike in demand.

In 2023, maintenance shutdowns were scheduled for all three major Kazakh r e\u0000neries: Shymkent went oﬄine from March 15 to April 7 (and additional unplanned Notes: Crude and r e\u0000ned products, in crude oil equivalent. *Days of consumption.

In the past, lengthy shutdowns of two r e\u0000neries in the same year for repairs have led to at least temporary shortages of gasoline and diesel, especially during times when domestic prices are rising.²⁹ Kazakhstan's existing oil storage capacity, established mainly to support operational needs of the transportation system, presently appears adequate to cover domestic r e\u0000nery needs in the event of a short-term disruption to regular supply. The bulk of crude storage in the country is held by the pipeline companies. KTO has nearly 1.2 million cubic meters of storage used for the operation of its pipeline system, which is suﬃcient to hold about 1.0–1.1 MMt of crude oil. This represents the equivalent of about 4 days of national oil production. Similarly, CPC holds 1.3 million cubic meters of storage (at its marine terminal on Russian territory). So between them, they can store the equivalent of about 10 days of national oil production. The r e\u0000neries also have operational storage for their crude oil stocks and for their \u0000nished products, but these volumes are relatively small (also representing only a few days of operations). What Kazakhstan does not have is strategic storage for crude to oﬀset sudden reductions in export demand or export capacity (pipelines); production itself must be adjusted in such circumstances. The current actual (operational) natural gas storage capacity in Kazakhstan is about 2.5 Bcm. However, in order to achieve the benchmark level of 20% of storage capacity relative to total annual gas consumption in the country, underground storage capacity should be 3–4 Bcm today, 6–7 Bcm by 2030 (at the consumption level envisaged in state planning documents), and 8–9 Bcm by 2030 assuming continued robust demand growth. The key locations where additional capacity is needed are the areas near the Saryarka pipeline, to ensure uninterrupted supplies to Astana, and areas in southern Kazakhstan, taking into consideration the limited capacity of the Beyneu-Bozoy-Shymkent pipeline during the autumn-winter period. There are several options for increasing storage capacity. The least costly strategy, and the one that could be most quickly implemented, would be to bring the existing Bozoy and Akyrtobe underground storage facilities to their design capacity. The total design capacity of the three current underground gas storage facilities is 4.65 Bcm, which would be suﬃcient to reach the benchmark storage indicator at current consumption volumes. However, given the projected future growth in consumption, it is necessary to take additional steps to increase capacity—through the creation of new underground gas storage facilities. In Kazakhstan, there are a number of potential sites for these facilities (depleted gas \u0000elds, salt deposits, etc.), but the most promising in terms of location and development possibilities are the Zhezkazgan-Karakoinsky salt deposits. However, the potential storage capacity at this new site does not exceed 1 Bcm in the medium term. QazaqGaz has developed and sent to the Ministry of Energy a draft Roadmap for the expansion of existing and creation of new underground gas storage facilities in Kazakhstan, and the government is considering the issue of \u0000nancing.2.3.2.2 Electricity system reliability Estimates by the IEA indicate that if the world is to reach the goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, fully half of global \u0000nal energy consumption will need to be in the form of electricity, up from only 20% at present. And nearly all that electricity will need to be produced from low-carbon sources, up from only 38% today. This increased elec tri\u0000cation will place a major strain on national electricity systems—the infrastructure for electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. This strain probably will be compounded by more extreme weather, wild\u0000res, and other"}

This represents a total investment of approximately $20–30 trillion for power generation alone; transmission and distribution will require even more capex.³¹ Balancing and exible generation. The increasing share of intermittent renewable energy within the grid will need to be matched by adequate balancing resources and \u0000exible (dispatchable) generation capacity.³² One way of mitigating balancing and dispatchable power challenges is improved interconnection of diﬀerent regional and/or national grids using high-voltage links, so that supply de\u0000cits (or surpluses) can be mitigated by sizable inter-grid transfers. But a more important approach to reinforcing grid balancing capacity (in addition to increasing electricity storage) is the creation of “capacity markets” that pay generators of \u0000exible power to build and maintain capacity that may be needed only during relatively short periods of peak demand. Companies whose resources are needed only infrequently nevertheless must be able to remain in business to support reliable supply even when they are idle for long periods. Digitalization and automated control. Distributed energy systems (with electricity entering the system from numerous small generation points such as rooftop solar PV or small wind farms) demand higher levels of grid and system performance than highly centralized ones; this will require more digitalization and automated control systems. It will also require more ancillary services (frequency control and switching, reactive power support, spinning reserves, etc.) to maintain reliability. Digitalized “smart grids,” dynamic line ratings, advanced power \u0000ow control, intentional islanding schemes (enabling distributed resources to supply local loads when the grid cannot), and other technical and operational approaches all can play a role in increasing system reliability. And end-user power consumption can be better monitored and controlled via automated demand management systems operating at variable time scales (diurnal, seasonal). 29 In April 2023, the government increased the maximum allowable retail prices of AI-92 and AI-93 gasoline by around 11%. At the same time, the maximum allowable retail diesel price was raised by about 20% for Kazakh citizens (a higher diesel price applies to foreign citizens since August 2022). For details on pricing, see Chapter 3 and, especially, Chapter 5. 30 Bordoﬀ and O'Sullivan, \"The Age of Energy Insecurity.\" 31 S&P Global, Global Power and Renewables Strategic Report, Decarbonizing Electric Power: Key challenges amid a global energy crunch and climate negotiations , 16 November 2021, pp. 4–5. One estimate of the annual expenditure to 2050 needed just to ensure the reliability of the expanded grid is upwards of $1 trillion (\"The Ultimate Supply Chains,\" The Economist [T echnology Quarterly Supplement], 8 April 2023). 32 Balancing is the process of matching the volumes of power generation and consumption within a grid, which is greatly complicated on the supply side when the share of intermittent renewable generation capacity increases. Flexibility (dispatchability) refers to the ability of a generation source to rapidly ramp up or ramp down the volume of electric power generation in response to demand \u0000uctuations.KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 46 Long-duration energy storage. Further penetration of renewable power would be greatly facilitated by the development of much higher capacity for long-duration storage of electricity than is currently available. Even as battery costs continue to come down and technology improvements enable batteries to store electric power over longer periods, they are unlikely to get cheap or large enough to perform the role of system “ \u0000rming” on their own. As a result, another class of resources is needed to ensure reliability, namely power generation assets that are both “low carbon” and “\u0000rm” (i.e., consistently dispatchable for extended periods of time without interruption). Until these next-generation assets (e.g., green hydrogen, geothermal, pumped hydro) become commercially available, some existing zero-carbon (nuclear) or low-carbon (natural gas) technologies that are both \u0000rm and \u0000exible must continue to play a major role.³³ In the meantime, the mismatch over the coming decade between the rate of renewable capacity build (rapid) and dispatchable capacity (stagnant or even declining as a result of planned coal and nuclear plant retirements) will present a major challenge to electricity system reliability. Long-distance electricity transmission. The geographic mismatch between regions with highly favorable renewable potential and regions of concentrated high electricity demand in many countries (e.g., mainland China, the United States, Germany) makes it important to signi\u0000cantly expand high-voltage transmission lines to better to respond to seasonal demand \u0000uctuations. HVDC (high voltage, direct current) lines are a solution for long distance transmission (exceeding a few hundred kilometers), but they have drawbacks such as expensive conversions between direct and alternating current (using insulated gate bipolar transistors) and the requirement of single injection node and withdrawal node. HVDC lines also have important applications in grid linkage, enabling the connection of independent grids that cannot simply be merged into a bigger synchronous system. A recent important lesson for Kazakhstan . A recent example of the importance of maintaining power system reliability in Kazakhstan, and its interconnection with the country's energy and economic security more broadly, can be found in the consequences of a brief disruption of power supply in western Kazakhstan in early July 2023. On 3 July an emergency shutdown of a generator at the MAEK thermal power station led to the shutdown of the 220 kV Beyneu-T engiz transmission line. As a result, Mangystau Oblast was eﬀectively cut oﬀ from Kazakhstan's main grid, and the eﬀects then cascaded to Atyrau Oblast, with interruption of power supply across the region, including important consumers such as upstream oil producers, the Atyrau oil re\u0000nery, and export pipelines.³⁴ During the outage, consumers in Atyrau and Mangystau oblasts were temporarily supplied with power from Russia (130 MW via a 220 kV transmission line (Uralsk-Atyrau)). The situation was resolved by 7 July, when full power output at MAEK was restored, but the power cuts"}

This is not an easy task in countries where access to electricity remains elusive, for example. Ensuring energy access raises the diﬃcult questions involving how best to connect underserved communities to aﬀordable energy without compromising the reliability of energy systems. Many multilateral development banks are seeking to address energy poverty through a combination of grid expansion and distributed renewables. Financial aid commitments from developed countries—such as those promised in the Paris Climate Agreement—can assist in this eﬀort. However, current levels of funding are inadequate to rapidly expand electricity services and improve reliability for developing countries. Kazakhstan is an example of a country that thus far has done a reasonably good job at providing equitable access to aﬀordable energy for its population. One of the three dimensions of the World Energy Council's annual World Energy Trilemma Index ranking of countries' energy system performance is Energy Equity, which measures a population's access to electricity and the aﬀordability of electricity, natural gas, and oil products.³⁶ In the most recent ranking on the Energy Equity component (2022, using 2021 data), Kazakhstan ranked in the upper one-third of thcountries (36 of 127 ranked countries), basically on par with developed nations in northwestern Europe, Arab Persian Gulf states, and United States. Thus, it appears that Kazakhstan's challenge rather is how to sustain widespread availability without unduly compromising aﬀordability—i.e., how to incentivize domestic deliveries of commercial gas, electricity and heat, and crude for domestic r e\u0000ning through eﬀective price and taxation policies that do not increase energy prices so rapidly and by such magnitude that they spark a public backlash (as occurred in Sri Lanka in 2022, when r e\u0000ned products shortages and price increases led the government to deploy the military to fuel stations to quell civil unrest). Land use conicts. A major challenge to sustaining energy policy resilience in the transition to lower-carbon forms of energy involves emerging land use con \u0000icts. Renewable power generation has a relatively low “power density” (i.e., power output possible per unit of land utilized) vis-à-vis conventional thermal power production. Therefore, the land area needed for decarbonized electric power generation will ultimately be orders of magnitude greater than that used for thermal generation. T o some extent renewable energy developers can seek to mitigate land use competition by targeting locations where such competition with alternative land uses is minimized. One option would be to locate renewable generation on otherwise less productive tracts of land, such as areas without water or with steeper slopes or polluted soil. Another strategy might involve repurposing the sites of shuttered or soon-to-be-closed coal- and 33 Decarbonizing Electric Power, p. 3 and S&P Global, Global Power and Renewables Strategic Report Thermal Revival: The global quest for dispatchable long-duration power sources , June 2023. 34 Interfax Central Asia & Caucasus Business Weekly , 4 July 2023. 35 Argus Eurasia Energy , 6 July 2023, p. 4; Energy Intelligence, Nefte Compass , 5 July 2022, p. 4. 36 https://www.worldenergy.org/publications/entry/world-energy-trilemma- index-2022. KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 47 gas-\u0000red plants for renewable power generation. Not all traditional power plant sites are optimal for wind or solar generation, but they do have the advantage of already having power grid connections.³⁷ Another option for avoiding land use competition is arguably to locate oﬀshore. In fact, some population-dense geographies, such as South Korea and Indonesia, already consider \u0000oating PV a third solar tier along with rooftop and ground-mount installations. And in densely populated Europe, oﬀshore wind already is a centerpiece of the energy transition. However, even location oﬀshore does not entirely remove the developer from con\u0000icts emerging over competing uses (e.g., with \u0000sheries, conservation, shipping, and tourism interests). Land use competition is not presently a major impediment to sustainable energy development in Kazakhstan, given the country's large land area and low population density, although it may eventually become a factor in the vicinity of major urban centers. 2.3.3 Transparency The sharing of information is shown to be a highly eﬀective response to an energy security concern. The International Energy Agency, for example, was created in 1974 by the United States, Canada, Japan, and several European countries in response to the Arab Oil Embargo which had resulted in acute r e\u0000ned product shortages and skyrocketing prices. At the same time, the dearth of accurate data on prices and supplies complicated governments' eﬀorts to devise policies and eﬀectively respond to the crisis. The lesson learned from that crisis was clear: “good data allows markets to function, prevents panic, and deters the speculation that exacerbates price spikes, volatility, and shortages.”³ ⁸ Over the subsequent decades, data on energy provided by such large international organizations as the IEA, OPEC, International Gas Union, and World Nuclear Association have supported informed decision-making, by governments, industry, and consumers about production levels, demand, and reserves and their in\u0000uence on pricing. A clean-energy economy will require the same kind of transparency and information-sharing eﬀort for critical minerals, hydrogen, ammonia, and renewable energy equipment. 2.4 Energy (In)security and the Pace of the Energy Transition A much-debated question in the current environment (of post- pandemic economic recovery and disrupted and reoriented global supply chains) is whether the new “energy insecurity” will delay or (conversely) accelerate the pace of the energy transition. In addressing this question, it should \u0000rst be noted that the interactions between policies enacted for the purpose of enhancing the energy security of individual countries and ongoing eﬀorts to shift to lower-carbon energy systems to combat climate change are multifaceted, and complex, and"}

Another diﬃculty lies in the popular (mis)conception of the energy transition, and how it is expected by many to unfold. Historical, global-scale transitions in energy (e.g., the transition from wood to coal, and subsequently from coal to petroleum) were protracted, taking many decades if not a century or more to fully run their course. Yet, sensing the urgency of responding to climate change, activists have rapidly ratcheted up emissions reduction targets and the emissions reduction timetable over the period since the Kyoto Protocol (1997) operationalized the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992), by committing signator y countries to speci\u0000c emissions reduction pledges. Not only was the rather nebulous goal of holding the global mean temperature increase to below 2°C (relative to pre-industrial levels)—established at COP21 in Paris (2015)—subsequently tightened to the previously aspirational 1.5°C target (now canonized as the level necessary to avert catastrophic impacts from climate change), but a deadline (2050) for net-zero carbon emissions in support of reaching this target was enunciated for the \u0000rst time.³⁹ The anxiety over the issue obscures the fact that the world has already warmed by an estimated 1.2°C relative to pre-industrial levels, and that another decade of emissions at or near current levels would erase what has been estimated as the entire remaining “carbon budget” (estimated future GHG emissions allowance) needed to remain below the 1.5°C threshold. The chances of meeting the 1.5°C target are now exceedingly small—our S&P Global In\u0000ections base case envisions 2.4°C of warming out to 2100—as long as the world's two most populous countries (and major emitters) do not plan to reach net zero until 2060 (China) and 2070 (India).⁴⁰ Complicating the path still further are the growing impacts of natural events believed to be related to climate change on plans to curb emissions, such as wild\u0000res and methane releases from thawing permafrost.⁴¹ In summary, the campaign to reach net zero will be an extremely challenging, multidecadal process that requires extraordinary changes in energy use, technology, and policy over the next three decades. A less ambitious, and likely more realistic perspective on the energy transition is that it can be said to have occurred when hydrocarbons account for less than 50% of primary energy—through a process that entails more gradual changes than presently deemed necessary in the popular narrative, and more adaptation to a changing climate than currently assumed. Despite these challenges in conceptualizing energy security and the energy transition, over the long term, the evidence supports the idea that a transition toward more widely available forms of renewable energy (wind and solar power) will fundamentally enhance energy security. For instance, some of the early discussions about energy security in the West—during the Arab Oil Embargo of the 1970s when there was widespread concern 37 See \"Trading Coal for Sunlight, Power Plants Get New Life, ” New York Times , 16 July 2022. 38 Bordoﬀ and O'Sullivan, \"The Age of Energy Insecurity.\" 39 The 2050 date gained traction as a hard deadline following the publication of a UNFCCC report in 2018 that estimated that achieving the 1.5°C target would require net-zero emissions around mid-century ( The Economist , 5 November 2022). 40 S&P Global Commodity Insights, Strategic Report, Energy and Climate Scenarios, Inections (2023-50): The S&P Global Commodity Insights base-case view of the energy future , July 2023, p. 3. 41 For instance, wild\u0000res accompanying drought conditions in California are estimated to have put twice as much carbon in the atmosphere in 2020 than had been reduced by all of the state's decarbonization policies over the period 2013–19. Similarly, North American and Eurasian wild\u0000res in 2021 produced higher CO ₂ emissions than oﬃcially recorded by any single country other than China, the United States, and India (David Wallace-Wells, \"One Grim Climate Lesson from the Canadian W ild\u0000res: For all our plans to control emissions, humans are no longer fully in charge,\" The New York Times Magazine, 30 July 2023). KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 48 over the perceived limits to and exhaustion of global oil supply—viewed the transition to renewable energy as a key part of the solution. As we observed in The National Energy Report 2021: ⁴² The current [2021] iteration of the energy transition, focused on decarbonization, has a precursor in even thlonger-standing 20 century concerns over energy security stand access . Even as recently as the \u0000rst decade of the 21 century, conventional wisdom still held that the world's hydrocarbon resources were limited and their continued utilization was threatened by looming shortages, given seemingly inexorable demand growth (as ex empli\u0000ed by fears of reaching “peak oil”). Further, the unequal distribution of fossil fuel energy resources among countries of the world was viewed as conferring a permanent economic advantage to so-called “petrostates” vis-à-vis countries lacking substantial oil and gas endowments. Under this view, a “transition” toward renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, which were ubiquitous (and coincidentally also zero- carbon), oﬀered a path to overcome both energy scarcity and its unequal spatial distribution. Of course, these more traditional motivations supporting an energy transition – i.e., the desire to possess adequate energy supplies not subject to exhaustion or political manipulation – have now been eclipsed by the more urgent need to respond to climate change . . . It is considered axiomatic that the energy transition can enhance energy security over the long term by diversifying supply sources and suppliers. Transportation, for example, most of which currently runs on oil, would be less vulnerable to fuel supply disruptions in a world where most vehicles are elec tri\u0000ed, as electricity can be generated from multiple energy sources. Furthermore, a more elec tri\u0000ed world would also be less subject to import disruptions caused by disputes among countries and accidents at key geographic chokepoints. ⁴³ But the reality is actually more complex: the transition largely involves switching one set of security concerns for another. Particularly in the near term it seems in many instances that the energy transition, particularly in its"}

As oil demand slows and then ebbs globally, global oil production will become increasingly concentrated in fewer countries where incremental and replacement barrels can be produced at lowest cost (which usually also means the lowest carbon footprint as well). Because many of these countries are located in the Middle East, the share of production from the OPEC+ group of producers will increase, by some estimates from 45% today to 57% by 2040. ⁴⁴ But it is worth noting that the shift to a net-zero energy economy will not eliminate energy security concerns; the geographic concentration in the production and processing of clean-energy minerals is even greater than for hydrocarbon production. Nonetheless, many signs now point toward energy security concerns accelerating the energy transition.⁴⁵ The energy supply chain disruptions in 2022 and 2023 had the net eﬀect of driving up fossil fuel prices, making renewables more competitive on a cost basis. Global capex on wind and solar projects grew from $357 billion in 2021 to $490 billion in 2022, surpassing investment in oil and gas development for the \u0000rst time. Additional signs of an accelerating build-out of low-carbon energy include: ► United States. The IRA earmarks $386 billion in tax credits and subsidies for renewables and other green energy technologies over a 10-year period. This long period removes year-to-year uncertainties among potential investors about the availability of funding. Since enactment of the legislation, nearly 100 new clean-energy manufacturing facilities or factory expansions have been announced, involving more than $70 billion in new investment, as well as plans for the construction of 96 GW of new renewable electricity generation capacity.⁴⁶ ► European Union (EU). The EU plans to make available at least $270 billion in funding for clean-energy companies and has brought forward its target for the doubling of installed solar capacity to 2025 from 2030. ►th China . Mainland China's 14 Five-Year Plan, unveiled in late December 2021, for the \u0000rst time has a target for the share of renewables in power generation (33% by 2025). ► Japan . Japan is pursuing a new \"green transformation\" plan (10 February 2023) that includes expansion of nuclear, hydrogen, and other low-emissions technologies. ► Global renewable capacity. The IEA now expects global renewable electricity generation capacity will more than double between 2022 and 2027, a 30% increase over its capacity estimate in 2021. It estimates that renewables will overtake coal as the largest source of electric power generation worldwide by 2025. ⁴⁷ Broadly, according to Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the IEA: “It’s notable that many of these new clean energy targets aren’t being put in place for climate reasons. Increasingly the big drivers are energy security [italics added] as well as industrial policy. . .” ⁴⁸ However, the directionality is not entirely toward acceleration, as in some obvious ways energy security concerns are delaying the energy transition in certain parts of the world. A prime example is the pushback from developing countries (especially in Africa) over what they view as the resistance of European institutions in helping them build out their energy infrastructure, particularly for natural gas. Developing countries believe the apparent singular emphasis on reducing emissions in the developed world needs to be balanced in their case against other urgent priorities—health, poverty reduction, and economic growth. In the immediate term, striving not to \"let the perfect be the enemy of the good,\" they are seeking to increase their consumption of natural gas to reduce indoor pollution, promote economic development and job creation, and, in many cases, eliminate the emissions and pollution that come from burning coal and biomass—the most carbon- intensive fuels in use. 42 The National Energy Report 2021 , p. 45. 43 Bordoﬀ and O'Sullivan, \"The Age of Energy Insecurity.\" 44 The Economist, 26 March 2022. 45 The Economist , 18 February 2023, p. 64. 46 New York Times , 18 June 2023. 47 New York Times , 7 December 2022. 48 New York Times , 28 October 2022. KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 49 In summary, the two energy problems (security and transition) are not separate \"either/or\" issues, but inextricably linked. Policymakers must update their approaches and methods to incorporate the new risks stemming from the new, less secure energy environment. \"Doing so is not a distraction from addressing climate change but central to it; without this shift, energy crises might derail the drive to net-zero emissions.\" ⁴⁹ 2.5 International (Extraterritorial) Mechanisms for Emissions Reduction and Their Potential Impacts on Kazakhstan thThe Paris Climate Agreement was signed at the 25 UN Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in Paris, France on 12 December 2015. Its signatory 196 countries pledged to limit the rise in global mean temperature to well below 2°C above pre- industrial levels through Nationally Determined Contributions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and established a system whereby aﬄuent developed countries would provide \u0000nancial assistance for decarbonization eﬀorts in developing states. An additional, less publicized accomplishment of the Paris Agreement was that it laid out a framework for the development of extraterritorial emission reduction schemes or mechanisms. More speci\u0000cally, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement outlines cooperative \"extraterritorial\" approaches that countries can pursue to extend the reach of their climate policies beyond their respective national borders. One example of this approach is the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which went into eﬀect on 16 May 2023. 2.5.1 Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) simultaneously seeks to: (a) encourage countries seeking to export goods to the EU market to adopt the EU's GHG emissions reduction strategies in the production of those goods; (b) protect domestic EU industries from \"unfair\" competition from imported goods produced without heed for those emissions reduction strategies; and (c) prevent \"carbon leakage\" from the EU—the re- location of European production to countries with less strict carbon regimes (either as a result of the physical relocation of production capacity outside the EU or by ceding market share to"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_NationalReport23_en_33", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\NationalReport23_en.pdf", "text": "\"dirtier\" producers as a result of the closure of European capacity). As such, CBAM is the \u0000rst extraterritorial mechanism that takes into account the carbon emissions embedded into products traded internationally. As the \u0000rst such framework of its kind, implementation of CBAM will be a complex and challenging task, with its validity and eﬀectiveness being scrutinized by industry representatives, climate activists, government oﬃcials, and the international business community. There is also a possibility of legal challenges by major exporting nations at the World Trade Organization (WTO). In The National Energy Report 2021 , we were able to examine an initial draft of CBAM issued by the European Commission in July 2021 for the purpose of starting the internal debate among member-states in the lead-up to its formal adoption. ⁵⁰ Now that CBAM is in force (henceforth, the \"extant CBAM\") and a pilot phase is scheduled for launch on 1 October 2023, it is useful to review its current provisions and to see how EU views on its functions have evolved since issuance of the 2021 draft. Although the basic scope and functions of CBAM remain broadly the same, some important diﬀerences exist. This provides greater clarity into the CBAM scope and implementation timetable, as well as implications for countries seeking to export carbon-intensive goods to the EU market. 2.5.1.1 Scope (emissions and industrial sectors covered) The greenhouse gases covered under the extant CBAM include those covered in the current EU Emissions Trading System: carbon dioxide (C О₂), per \u0000uorocarbons (PFCs), and nitrous oxide (N ₂O).⁵¹ Although in the 2021 draft, only direct emissions (Scope 1)—emissions directly resulting from the production process creating an export good—were included, the extant CBAM now includes \"indirect emissions” (Scope 2) in certain industries. ⁵² Importantly, the sectoral scope of the extant CBAM was expanded compared to the 2021 draft. Although the latter included \u0000ve industries—electric power, cement, fertilizers, aluminum, and iron-steel—the extant CBAM now adds hydrogen, ammonia, and downstream iron-steel products fabricated from steel. The addition of hydrogen and ammonia undoubtedly stems from a desire of EU policymakers to protect these nascent industries based on wind- and solar-generated electricity from competition from imports utilizing fossil fuels. ⁵³ EU policymakers have built in some capability to further adjust the sectoral scope of CBAM during a pilot phase that will precede the launch of the active (payment) phase of the program (see below). 2.5.1. 2 Implementation mechanism and timetable The initial draft CBAM called for its staged implementation, with a pilot phase (involving only emissions reporting) to begin on 1 January 2023 and entry in full force (\"active phase\") on 1 January 2026. The extant CBAM generally follows this general timetable, only with a lag of several months, with the pilot phase launching on 1 October 2023. During the active phase, exporters to the EU will receive a free allowance of \"CBAM cer ti\u0000cates\" (GHG emissions allowances, each equivalent to 1 ton of C О₂e) valid for one year. Exporters of goods with above-allowance emissions for a product will be required to purchase additional cer ti\u0000cates to compensate. ⁵⁴ Exporters will be able to receive credits/ compensation for carbon payments made in their home countries (in the form of a carbon tax or ETS payments). 49 Bordoﬀ and O'Sullivan, \"The Age of Energy Insecurity.\" 50 The National Energy Report 2021 , pp. 52–54. 51 https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/eu-emissions-trading-system-eu- ets_en#sectors--gases-covered. All of these gases are also covered by CBAM, although it appears N ₂O emissions would be included only in fertilizer imports . 52 Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions associated with the purchase and use of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling in the production process at the site of production. The indirect emissions are expected to be covered only for cement and fertilizer imports, on the basis of a methodology to be de\u0000ned during the pilot phase of the extant CBAM (https://taxation- customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en). 53 Argus Non-Ferrous Metals , 13 December 2021, p. 25. KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 50 Emissions reporting and accounting/compensation will occur annually and follow the same procedures as in the 2021 draft. Exporters are required to keep detailed records of their emissions for reporting purposes, or to accept \"default values\" for their emissions, based on the 10% of EU companies in the same industry reporting the highest emissions per unit of output. During the active phase the share of free allowances will gradually diminish, so that cer ti\u0000cate purchases will increase progressively: initially, importers will be required to buy cer ti\u0000cates for 2.5% of their emissions (2026), rising to 100% by 2034. ⁵⁵ This timetable for gradual reduction in free allowances is aligned with the phase- out of similar free GHG emissions allowances in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and full phase-out (2034) occurs some two years earlier in the extant CBAM than envisaged in the 2021 CBAM draft (2036)—another example of energy security concerns accelerating the energy transition. 2.5.1. 3 Exemptions In the 2021 draft, countries whose emissions trading systems are integrated with or otherwise linked to the EU ETS (Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein, Switzerland, and small oﬀshore territories of the EU) were to be exempt from CBAM. In other cases, further bilateral agreements could be introduced in due course to account for, and deduct, carbon costs in the emissions systems of these nearby trading partners. Presumably, such a mechanism was to be applied to the United Kingdom, whose carbon market closely follows the EU ETS. In the extant CBAM, however, exemptions are only reported to extend to those countries with “an explicit carbon price,” leaving considerable space for interpretation. 2.5.1. 4 “Watch list” for scope expansion In the 2021 draft, non-fertilizer chemicals and r e\u0000ned oil products were listed among those industrial products that might be added to the scope of CBAM at some future date. The extant CBAM provides some clarity as to sectors that might be encompassed by the mechanism, and how soon. There is some sentiment in favor of \u0000rst extending CBAM coverage to byproducts or semi- products (kaolinite, ferroalloys, agglomerated iron"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_NationalReport23_en_34", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\NationalReport23_en.pdf", "text": "ore) in some of the industries already covered, as well as to organic chemicals, with eventual coverage possibly encompassing the entire sectoral range of the EU ETS by 2030. ⁵⁶ The latter would include a broad range of industries not currently subject to CBAM, including: re\u0000ned petroleum products, nonferrous metals, ceramics, pulp- paper, organic chemicals, and maritime transport. Yet for now, CBAM is in its very early stages, so its ultimate form remains to be determined. 2.5.1. 5 Trade impact for Kazakhstan In The National Energy Report 2021 we attempted to gain an approximate perspective on the scale of the impacts of CBAM implementation on Kazakhstan's economy based on a review of exports of goods in categories included in the draft CBAM, based on available foreign trade statistics for Kazakhstan in the immediately preceding years (2018 and 2019). We found then that the immediate eﬀects on Kazakhstan were quite modest: only $193 million of goods exported to Europe (all European countries, not only EU members) were covered by CBAM, less than 1% of the total value of Kazakhstan's exports to the EU ($24.8 billion in 2019). We repeat this exercise for 2023 using the categories listed in the extant CBAM for 2022; again, the eﬀect on Kazakhstan would appear to be manageable: only $2.5 billion of these CBAM-related goods were exported to all countries in 2022 (not just EU members), representing only about 3% of the total value of Kazakhstan's overall exports. Furthermore, the bulk of these goods were exported to neighboring countries, with very little going to the EU. 2.5.2 Other extraterritorial emissions reduction mechanisms Although CBAM is the \u0000rst extraterritorial mechanism of emissions reduction that takes into account the carbon emissions embedded into products traded internationally, it likely will not be the only one. International trade is viewed as a key lever in extending the reach of climate policies to other states outside the national borders. As a consequence, climate policies are increasingly coming into tension with the post–World War II global trade system geared towards the removal of trade barriers under the auspices of the WTO and related bodies. This system led to expanded trade based on comparative advantage and resulting costs of production; it did not take into account the environmental costs of mitigating GHG emissions. Now, in the present environment of increased geopolitical uncertainties, climate concerns (sometimes merged with those centered on national security) are leading to the enactment of new national industrial and trade policies: (a) incentivizing the development of nascent clean-energy technologies and industries (e.g., tax incentives and subsidies for electric vehicles, batteries, and clean-energy minerals provided in the US In\u0000ation Reduction Act of 2022); and (b) tariﬀs on imports, either to penalize producers of goods for high GHG emissions, to protect new domestic industries from competition, or both (CBAM). These new trade and industrial policies have tended to enjoy considerable domestic political support, appealing both to those advocating more aggressive climate action and to those in favor of protecting jobs and industries from perceived external threats (e.g., competition from China in the case of the United States). The Global Arrangement on Sustainable Steel and Aluminum (henceforth GASSA), now being negotiated, is the \u0000rst speci\u0000c initiative after CBAM in which a group of countries (in this case, the United States, the EU, and possibly similar like- minded countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan) are proposing to enact tariﬀs on imports of steel, aluminum, and their products from countries in which production of these commodities results in GHG emissions above a certain threshold. The United States and EU have been holding talks on the proposed agreement since 2021, and recent reports indicate suﬃcient progress has been made so that a \u0000nal decision is expected by October 2023. ⁵⁷Although formulation of a methodology to measure the carbon footprint of these industries 56 Argus Non-Ferrous Metals , 13 December 2021, p. 25. 54 T o facilitate the description, the text is worded in such a way that the exporter is described as incurring the costs of compliance, whereas in actuality, the actual payment will be made (in one way or another) by the party in the EU that arranges for the imports of the goods. 55 S&P Global Regional Integrated Insight, CBAM: Europe agrees carbon tax for importers of selected products , 16 January 2023. KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 51 initially was reported to pose a challenge, it appears that CBAM methods to measure compliance of these industries, now in place, oﬀer a template to move forward. GASSA envisions a tiered system of tariﬀs. More speci\u0000cally, GASSA members, who must document compliance with the agreement's emissions standards, will pay no tariﬀs; steel and aluminum imports from other countries will be subject to a rising scale depending upon their emissions. Similar to CBAM, GASSA emissions standards are intended to become more rigorous over time, to incentivize continued progress in emissions reduction. In the current geopolitical environment, more such industry- speci\u0000c climate and trade agreements among like-minded states are possible, given the current lack of momentum for more comprehensive (both geographically and sectorally) international trade pacts. If agreements between the US and EU can be forged for aluminum and steel, for example, it does not seem implausible that future talks could be devoted to other widely traded commodities under CBAM coverage (e.g., cement, fertilizers, or hydrogen). 2.6 How Much Will the Energy Transition Cost? One of the most important questions from a national (energy) security perspective involves the overall cost of the energy transition and its potential impacts on economic performance, jobs wages, and vulnerable populations. Anxiety about the cost of the transition is a genuine concern and perhaps the single biggest obstacle to achieving political consensus on the implementation of a net-zero carbon strategy. This is a very complex issue; it is diﬃcult, if not impossible, to provide answers with a high degree of precision or speci\u0000city. However, S&P Global analysts have attempted to address this question for a selected country, the United States, and a"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_NationalReport23_en_35", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\NationalReport23_en.pdf", "text": "collaborative eﬀort by German and Kazakh analysts have carried out a similar analysis for Kazakhstan. ⁵⁸ Their \u0000ndings at least shed some light on broad cost parameters of the pathway to net-zero and help in identifying groups and sectors that will be most heavily impacted. It should be emphasized from the outset that the costs cited here are based on hypothetical net- zero projections based on particular pathways; these are not the most likely future outcomes. Few if any countries in the world are presently on track to achieve their net zero pledges, and the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is now viewed by many as already out of reach. 2.6.1 Estimated costs for the United States The US analysis utilizes a proprietary S&P Global Fast Transition® scenario that incorporates as its basic inputs the changes in energy production and consumption that would be necessary for the United States to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and calculates three basic cost components: ► direct energy expenditures by consumers ► related societal costs borne by the population, including: \u0000 direct costs for electric vehicle and heat pump purchases as well as tax payments by citizens to support clean- energy subsidies and incentives \u0000 direct costs associated with the retraining of displaced workers in the fossil fuel industry \u0000 indirect costs associated with carbon mitigation ► corporate clean-energy infrastructure investment, primarily in the electric power grid. 2.6.1.1 Direct consumer expenditures on energy increase under net-zero, but only modestly for the US An important assumption underlying the Fast Transition scenario is that the current situation of heightened energy price volatility in 2022 and 2023 does not represent the \"normal\" situation. When considered as the \"total bill\" realized by end-use customers, in 2023 all US energy consumers are expected to spend around $1.7 trillion for energy in all its various end-uses, such as electricity for homes and business, natural gas used for space heating and industrial processes as well as oil for transportation and industrial feedstocks. ⁵⁹ This is a sharp increase compared with recent historical values of $1.1 trillion–$1.4 trillion. As a consequence, the Fast Transition scenario projects direct consumer expenditures to recede from current elevated levels to about $1.3 trillion (in real terms) by 2026, which it uses as a more normal base year for comparison with 2050. In the Fast Transition scenario, nal energy demand from end- users declines nearly 30% by 2050 while its composition changes dramatically. The single biggest driver of this decline is the transportation sector's conversion from internal combustion engines to battery electric and fuel cell electric drive trains, which are much more eﬃcient at the point of end use. ⁶⁰ More speci\u0000cally, electricity consumption grows by 67% and constitutes 42% of 2050 \u0000nal energy consumption. Natural gas use declines 34% but still plays a signi\u0000cant role in 2050, providing 26% of \u0000nal energy consumption. Oil consumption declines 87% and accounts for only 8% of 2050 \u0000nal energy use, mostly in specialized uses and as feedstock. Hydrogen grows from a negligible energy end use today to 10% of 2050's \u0000nal energy consumption. 57 New York Times , 4 October 2021, 8 December 2022, 11 March 2023. 58 The discussion in this section of the Report is based on, for the United States, S&P Global, Global Power and Renewables, Executive B rie\u0000ngs US Energy: Costs of achieving a net-zero transition across the US economy, 13 June 2023. For Kazakhstan, the basic document reviewed is DIW Econ GmbH and Astana oﬃce of the German Society for International Cooperation (in collaboration with Germany's Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety), Kazakhstan: Towards Net Zero by 2060—Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) of Kazakhstan, 19 September 2021. 59 In this characterization of energy costs, residential/commercial, industrial, and transportation sector expenses measure the cost of fuel consumed at the end- use level. End-use electricity cost is a single value aggregated across all sectors. Considering its size, economy-wide energy expense in the United States is signi\u0000cant yet modest compared to overall economic activity, amounting to about 6–7% of US GDP. 60 T o a large extent, this decline is an artifact of energy accounting, as many energy eﬃciency losses are shifted upstream of \u0000nal uses. As a result, primary energy demand declines by only about 7% through 2050. KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 52 The cost savings resulting from the reduction in \u0000nal energy demand, however, is oﬀset by the transition from relatively cheaper fuels such as coal and natural gas to relatively more expensive energy sources such as electricity and hydrogen. Consequently, beginning from the comparison base year of 2026, all consumer retail energy expenditures grow slowly (in real terms) from about $1.3 trillion annually in the 2020s to $1.4 trillion–$1.5 trillion in the 2040s, an increase of 8-15%. Direct energy expenditure by consumers is by far the largest cost category aﬀected by the transition. Changes in overall sector expenditures vary widely. While power expenditures increase by 72% over the 2026–50 period, mostly due to increasing sales volumes arising from elec tri\u0000cation, transportatio n expenditures decline by about 27%, r e\u0000ecting the longer-term elec tri\u0000cation trend. The replacement of gasoline and diesel with hydrogen and biofuels keeps transportation expenses from declining more. Residential/commercial expenditures are projected to decline about 17% owing to increased eﬃciencies resulting from elec tri\u0000cation. Conversely, measured from 2026, industrial energy expenditures increase about 21%, mostly owing to the replacement of natural gas and coal with hydrogen. It is important to keep in mind that backward-looking projections of direct energy expenditures historically (i.e., over the past two decades) have tended to overstate costs. A recent survey of the large energy models used to inform in\u0000uential reports issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that these models systematically overestimated the actual future costs of key green energy technologies. ⁶¹ Retrospective analysis revealed that these models built in overly conservative assumptions on renewable energy \u0000oor costs, deployment rates and technology"}

In contrast, so-called \"experience curve models\" that incorporate steady cost reductions as adoption increases generally yield more optimistic (lower) cost forecasts, but do seem to oﬀer better predictive power for the historical period. 2.6.1.2 Direct and indirect societal costs are oﬀsetting Societal costs in the S&P Global study of the US energy transition include both direct and indirect costs. Among the direct societal costs, in the overall scenario consumer investment costs increase to $44 billion annually in 2050, peaking at $174 billion in 2036, driven by the net purchase cost of clean electric vehicles (CEVs) after CEV incentives expire in 2035. Other direct societal costs (i.e., the cost to taxpayers of government incentives and oﬀsets) increase to $179 billion annually in 2050, peaking at $233 billion in 2040 (Figure 2.2 Societal cost of energy, other than retail energy costs).Among these other direct societal costs are the costs of retraining and relocating workers in the fossil fuel industry (e.g., in coal mining, oil and gas extraction, oil r e\u0000neries, and power plants) displaced by the transition to cleaner forms of energy. In the United States at present, there are 900,000 such workers, and it is not clear how easily the bulk of them could be retrained and re- employed in new clean-energy jobs. The In\u0000ation Reduction Act seeks to anticipate this problem by setting aside $4 billion in tax credits for clean-energy companies to invest in new projects in “energy communities”—towns in regions of coal and oil and gas extraction that are impacted by fossil fuel site closures. ⁶² The eﬀectiveness of the program will need to be monitored, as it is not clear whether the incentives will be adequate to induce companies to invest in such communities vis-à-vis other sites more proximal to centers of large and growing power demand. Oﬀsetting the increase in direct societal costs, indirect costs (i.e., externalities based on the environmental cost of carbon) decline from $308 billion in 2023 to zero in 2050. These indirect costs or carbon externalities, also known as the “social costs of carbon,” encompass the costs of all climate change impacts, including (but not limited to) changes in net agricultural productivity, human health eﬀects, property damage from increased \u0000ood risk and wild\u0000re natural disasters, disruption of energy systems, risk of con\u0000ict, environmental migration, and the value of ecosystem services. While there still are carbon emissions in 2050, they have been counterbalanced by purchases of carbon oﬀsets at a cost of about $66 billion. Therefore, the view on trends in the energy transition's total societal costs depends on whether to include carbon externalities as valid societal costs. When excluding consideration of carbon externalities, the societal cost of energy in 2050 is expected to be 17% higher than in 2026; but when carbon externalities are included as a societal cost, society's total energy cost in 2050 is 3% less than in 2026. Thus, regardless of perspective and considering that consumers will be shifting to higher-priced energy sources, the energy transition, if implemented in a manner like the Fast Transition case, does not appear to drive total costs of energy to prohibitive levels. 2.6.1.3 A net-zero power sector requires substantial additional electric power investment expenditure Power sector infrastructure capex in the United States over the period 2023–50 amounts to about $7.1 trillion in Fast Transition, 85% higher than the $3.7 trillion estimated for the S&P Global Planning Case® (\"business as usual\"). Signi \u0000cantly higher investment levels are expected for both the transmission grid and grid-connected generation. Wind and solar account for over 70% of total generation capital expenditure over the period, and batteries account for another 14%.⁶³ When annualized, the additional electric power investment required under a 2050 net- zero scenario (compared to business as usual) would amount to approximately $90 billion per year. 61 For instance, a model used by the IEA in 2010 to project the cost of solar energy in 2020 estimated a cost of $260 per megawatt-hour (MWh), whereas the actual cost in 2020 turned out to be $50/MWh. For details, see R. Way, M. Ives, P. Mealy, and J.D. Farmer, \"Empirically Grounded T echnology Forecasts and the Energy Transition,\" Joule, Vol. 6, No. 9, 2022, pp. 2057–2082; see also R. Way, \"Modeling a Greener Future,\" The American Scientist , Vol. 111, No. 4, July–August 2023, pp. 208–210. 62 In addition to the credits, the IRA also makes available loans for companies to repurpose shuttered fossil fuel sites as clean-energy projects ( New York Times , 12 July 2023). 63 Increases in distribution investments are tempered by Fast Transition's decarbonization approach, which minimizes the impact of elec tri\u0000cation on the distribution grid peak demand and instead assumes the \u0000nal decarbonization tranche comes from oﬀsets. Full end-use elec tri\u0000cation would entail much higher distribution costs.

Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global. 2.6.2 Estimated costs for Kazakhstan to reach net zero The applicability of a scenario projecting potential US costs of attaining net-zero emissions to the situation in Kazakhstan has obvious limitations. The structure of economic activity and energy consumption in the two countries is quite diﬀerent. In the United States, the transportation sector (37%) dominates the structure of \u0000nal energy demand, followed by industry (35%), the residential sector (16%), and commercial uses (12%). In Kazakhstan, in contrast, the residential (33%) and industrial (32%) sectors dominate, with transportation having a much smaller role (18%), followed by the commercial sector (16%).⁶⁴ The fuel mix in primary energy demand also varies, with oil (38% of total demand) and gas (32%) dominating in the United States, while it is coal (50%), oil (18%), and gas"}

At present, about 80% of all annual GHG emissions in Kazakhstan is generated in the energy sector. And within energy, electric power generation alone accounted for nearly half (46%) of Kazakhstan's total GHG emissions in 2022; 87% of these power-sector emissions come from coal-\u0000red plants. Consequently, a fuel switch from coal to natural gas or renewables in electric power generation would result in signi\u0000cant reductions in Kazakhstan's energy-sector GHG emissions, although these would be oﬀset to some degree by increasing emissions from the transportation of gas to power plant sites. Another factor aﬀecting the costs of reaching net zero for Kazakhstan (vis-à-vis the United States) is the lack of domestic capacity for manufacturing renewable energy equipment (e.g., turbine nacelles, solar panels) in Kazakhstan, which necessitates more costly imports. A partial accounting of the costs to Kazakhstan of achieving net- zero emissions was undertaken in a joint 2021 study involving German and Kazakh researchers.⁶⁶ Its basic \u0000ndings are similar to the S&P Global analysis for the United States, concluding: ► A future with net-zero GHG emissions by 2060 in Kazakhstan is both technically possible and economically feasible. ► However, achieving this goal will require deep structural changes throughout the entire economy—from power generation and industry, to buildings and the transport sector, to agriculture and land use. It also includes a thorough and fundamental transformation of the energy sector in particular: o Gas will account for nearly 15% of total primary energy production in 2060 (down only slightly from 16% in 2022), and oil for about the same share (but down from 47% in 2022). These shares will be signi\u0000cantly less than wind or solar resources (72% in aggregate, up exponentially from 1.5% in 2022). Coal will be nearly non- existent (less than 0.1% total primary energy production, compared to nearly 36% in 2022). ► Carbon neutrality will require the mobilization of substantial investments over the entire period to 2060, although for most of the time in aggregate it does not exceed historic investment to GDP ratios for Kazakhstan. The Kazakh-German study does not break down the costs of net zero into the same categories as the S&P Global study for the 64 US \u0000nal demand statistics are for 202 1(https://www.eia.gov/ energyexplained/us-energy-facts/images/consumption-by source-and- sector.pdf); Kazakhstan's statistics are for 2022. 65 BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2022 , p. 9. 66 Kazakhstan: Towards Net Zero by 2060 , pp. 40-41. 400 500 600 BTM solar Customer elect ri\u0000cation Customer CEV net costs CEV incentives Clean energy tax credits RNG subsidy Ethanol and biodiesel subsidy Oﬀsets Carbon externalities 100 200 300 2023 2028 2033 2038 2043 2048KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 54 US—direct consumer expenditures on energy, direct and indirect societal costs, and power system upgrading along with expansion investments. Nor does it utilize the same decarbonization timetable (using 2060 as an end-date rather than 2050). However, it does provide an estimate of at least how much net incremental (additional) investment in power-sector and other clean-energy technologies is required over the four-decade period 2021-60: a massive $666.5 billion, or roughly triple Kazakhstan’s 2022 total nominal GDP of $223.5 billion in 2022. This amounts to an annual average of just over $17 billion, compared with $30-32 billion annually in recent years for total investment in the economy or about $8 billion in oil and gas extraction or about $1.9 billion annually in electric power. Presumably this estimated investment \u0000gure would signi\u0000cantly overlap with the societal costs and elec tri\u0000cation investment categories used in the US study, by encompassing investments in energy infrastructure by the Kazakh government and companies and purchases by Kazakh consumers of EVs, home solar panels, energy-eﬃciency appliances, etc. But it presumably would not include other direct societal costs, such as the burden on taxpayers of clean-energy subsidies and tax incentives, the costs of worker retraining and relocation, and the need to provide \u0000nancial support to vulnerable social groups via targeted subsidies. Nonetheless, an expected reduction of 9,335 MMtCO ₂e of GHG emissions over the scenario period is expected to yield a substantial savings in indirect societal costs (of GHG emissions on public health, economic productivity, etc.), which the study estimates will reduce the overall decarbonization price to a relatively low $71.5 per ton of CO ₂e.⁶⁷ In the most intensive early investment phase until 2030, the investment share in GDP is projected to reach 34%, which is slightly above the average for World Bank–designated upper- middle-income countries as well as peak investment levels in Kazakhstan in 2008-14. But after 2030, the investment share of GDP declines and, by 2050, begins to approach the pre-pandemic level of 2019. ⁶⁸ According to the authors, it is important to keep in mind that much of the investment in zero- or low-carbon technologies would eventually be needed in any event, to retire aging (high-carbon) capital assets that have exceeded their useful lifetimes. Almost the entire capital stock in power and heat generation would need to be replaced over the next four decades to 2060. ⁶⁹ In both Kazakhstan and the United States, the direction of the transition points to greater elec tri\u0000cation—in the United States, a movement from gasoline and diesel fuels toward electric traction and the related charging and manufacturing infrastructure, and in Kazakhstan increased elec tri\u0000cation and energy eﬃciency in buildings and cleaner fuels overall. The \u0000nancing of decarbonization investments in Kazakhstan through higher consumer direct expenditures on energy is challenging economically (and fraught politically), because current regulations ensuring low consumer tariﬀs for electricity, heat, and fossil fuels provide inadequate resources for upgrading networks and switching to more sustainable generation sources. Therefore, in order to decarbonize the power and heat sector, the introduction of market prices for energy services will be necessary, in order both to create the revenues needed for 67 Kazakhstan: Towards Net Zero by 2060 , p. 40. 68 Kazakhstan: Towards Net Zero by 2060 , pp. 40-41. 69 By far the largest"}

Kazakh energy policymakers are now considering how to distribute energy price hikes across the economy and among the population, while avoiding major disruption for both producers and consumers and mitigating public opposition (for an outline of various support measures that can be utilized to reduce the burden of rising energy prices on the population, see Section 2.9 of this chapter). 2.7 Energy Company Transition Strategies Have Been Adjusted by Emerging Energy Security Concerns The response of the business sector to the energy transition has proven complex. For energy producers, many now expect that they will reach maximum oil and gas output earlier and at lower levels than forecasted prior to the pandemic and have pursued portfolio diversi \u0000cation, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), divestments, and new clean-energy ventures to address the energy transition. But energy security concerns stemming from rising prices and disrupted supply chains have caused many industry executives to reassess their business plans and approaches to the transition in general. In The National Energy Report 2021, we focused on the strategies employed by three categories of large oil and gas companies—\" \u0000rst movers,\" traditional international oil companies (IOCs), and national oil companies (NOCs)—to navigate the energy transition. ⁷⁰ We believe this categorization remains useful in understanding how companies have responded to the new security concerns—not through a fundamental transformation of their approach to the transition but rather through subtle, yet nonetheless substantive, modi\u0000cations. Importantly, despite maintaining long-term net-zero plans, most oil and gas companies, particularly the Western supermajors, now intend to either keep growing upstream production deep into this decade or maintain production at higher levels than they had announced only a couple years ago. ⁷¹ The apparent contradiction highlights the majors' attempts to meet competing calls for energy security and the low-carbon transition amid the Ukraine war and intensifying global climate crisis. But it also speaks to a potentially uncomfortable reality: While majors' pathways to net zero have always been a bit fuzzy, their primary role as oil and gas producers has never been in doubt — and the group is now realizing that this must remain this way for a considerable time. 2.7.1 First movers First movers are those IOCs that have embraced the transition, seeking to transform themselves over time from oil and gas producers to broadly div ersi\u0000ed energy companies. This group also could be termed the \"European majors,\" as most are KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 55 headquartered there: BP; Shell PLC; T otalEnergies; Galp Energia SGPS, S.A.; and Eni. Equinor, the Norwegian national oil and gas company, also typically is included in this group because its transition strategy closely resembles that of the other \u0000rst-mover companies. In 2021, we described some key common transition strategies utilized by the \u0000rst movers (broadly applicable to the group if not in all speci\u0000c cases): ► Portfolio div ersi\u0000cation via downsizing of petroleum assets through divestment or non-replacement of oil and gas reserves ► Reconceptualization of the company mission as providing energy as a service rather than hydrocarbon commodities, with an expansion into renewable electric power generation adding a less volatile (if at times less lucrative) future income stream ► A commitment to emissions reduction, not only that associated with their operations (Scope 1 and 2) but also with the consumption of their products (Scope 3) as a result of conscious plans to curb the growth of their oil and gas output and ultimately to reduce it.⁷² ► A plan to use the revenues from oil and gas production to invest in new \"green\" ventures (renewable power, hydrogen). The disruption in global energy markets (and resulting price hikes) in 2022 brought record earnings to oil and gas producers, including the \u0000rst movers. In some ways, Russia's con\u0000ict with Ukraine may have accelerated their move away from oil and gas, as BP and Shell (alongside other IOCs such as ExxonMobil) moved to divest major assets they held in Russia. In other cases, hydrocarbon divestitures were planned longer in advance and are consistent with \u0000rst movers' overall decarbonization plans, such as T otalEnergies’ sale of Canadian oil sands assets and Shell’s exit from shale oil and gas production in the US Permian Basin in 2021. But the \u0000rst movers have selectively continued to invest in the development of oil and gas assets, most notably now in Africa, due to several perceived advantages: ► an Eastern Hemisphere geography viewed as relatively proximal to Europe by sea ► governments favorably disposed toward hydrocarbon development ► green\u0000eld sites that facilitate installation of modern, eﬃcient, and comparatively “clean” extraction infrastructure. Examples of this \"turn to the south\" include recent deals by Eni to develop natural gas in Libya, by Shell and Equinor to develop LNG in Tanzania, and by TotalEnergies to develop projects in Mozambique (LNG) and Nigeria (oﬀshore oil and gas).⁷³ Yet clean energy is supposed to be a larger focus of new investments, which is expected to account for as much as half of capex by the European majors by 2030. Shell is now producing renewable electricity in nine countries (including Australia, India, and the United States), with plans to double generation by 2030. It is also involved in a partnership with a Chinese company to develop EV charging stations in Asia and Europe. ⁷⁴ BP and Eni have major investments in green hydrogen projects in Mauritania and Algeria, respectively; and Eni is currently building a small solar power plant in Kazakhstan’s Turkestan Oblast, after earlier completing two wind farms of 96 MW in Aktobe Oblast. ⁷⁵ And in South Africa, T otalEnergies has an interest in the Prieska solar power plant, which supplies electricity to over 70,000 households, and participates in several projects"}

It also markets solar panels in that country, and recently purchased a 50% stake in Clearway Energy, a US wind and solar power company, for $2.4 billion. And in June 2023, T otalEnergies signed a 25-year agreement to purchase electric power generated from the 1 GW Mirny wind farm in Zhambyl Oblast, Kazakhstan’s largest. ⁷⁶ Yet the most publicized events involving the \u0000rst movers represent what many clean-energy advocates view as a setback. On 7 February 2023, BP announced that it was scaling back its Scope 3 emissions reduction pledge; it had originally committed to a 35–40% emissions cut by 2030, but reduced this to 20–30%, citing the need to accommodate near-term energy security concerns: “to make sure that rapid transition is balanced and orderly, so that aﬀordable energy keeps \u0000owing where it’s needed today.” ⁷⁷ T o support this commitment to produce more oil and gas than originally planned over the medium term, BP announced it would increase capex by $1 billion annually, both for oil and gas production as well as in its transition businesses (e.g., biofuels, EV charging infrastructure, renewable power) and retreat from more ambitious plans to shrink its reserve base through divestitures and depreciation. As a consequence, BP envisions its 2030 crude oil output will be 25% less in 2030 (2 MMb/d) than at present, rather than 40% less, as originally planned. ⁷⁸ The move probably should be viewed more as a minor strategic adjustment than a wholesale revision of company strategy. The scaled-back oil production reduction target moves BP closer to those of fellow \u0000rst movers Shell and T otalEnergies, which have both stated an intention to keep production broadly \u0000at through the decade. And even despite the scaled-back emissions reduction target, which is now less ambitious than those of Shell and T otalEnergies (50% and 40% reductions, respectively, by 2030), S&P Global forecasts that BP will still have the lowest GHG emissions in absolute terms among the \u0000ve global \"supermajor\" oil and gas companies.⁷⁹ Echoing BP's strategic deceleration of its decarbonization goals, at Shell's Investor Day held in New York on 14 June 2023, CEO Wael Sawan announced plans to keep the company's oil and gas production steady at current levels (1.4 MMb/d) though 2030, instead of allowing it to fall by 1–2% per year under a previous plan. Citing a \"ruthless\" focus on \u0000nancial performance, he stated 72 Scope 3 emissions are those from activities or assets not owned or controlled by a company but result from the use of its products. 73 The Economist , 11 February 2023, pp. 57–58. 74 New York Times , 8 June 2022. 75 Energy Intelligence, Nefte Compass , 21 June 2023. 76 The $1.4 billion project is being developed by a multinational consortium that includes T otalEnergies (40% shareholding), KMG (20%), and Kazakhstan's Samruk-Kazyna National Fund (20%).

Environmental activists decried the move as a \"stealth\" pivot from low-carbon energy. 2.7.2 Traditional IOCs The traditional IOCs are large integrated oil companies that have tended (for the time being) to retain their traditional focus on upstream production. While not completely ignoring the energy transition, they adopted a more cautious, \"wait-and-see\" approach. This group could also be labeled the \"North American majors,\" as most are headquartered in either the United States or Canada. Primarily consisting of the US majors ExxonMobil and Chevron, it also includes somewhat smaller companies such as Canadian oil producers Cenovus, Suncor, and Imperial Oil. In 2021, these traditional IOCs employed strategies focused on: ► Continuing to develop core hydrocarbon assets (concentrated portfolios)—relatively lower-cost barrels in known geological environments near home (North American) markets, in stable geopolitical environments with existing infrastructure (e.g., Permian Basin, Gulf of Mexico) ► Maintaining capital discipline —limiting capex and operating costs through eﬃciency improvements, including digitalization (reduced labor costs in drilling and equipment monitoring; improved geologic data analysis, project design, seismic modeling, and \u0000eld development) ► Targeting emissions reduction eﬀorts on their own operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions), and generally avoiding any pledges for Scope 3 emission reductions; this includes an emphasis on such activities as increasing use of associated gas, reducing methane leakage and \u0000aring, and limiting new clean- energy initiatives to areas in which they have existing expertise; e.g., carbon, capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), biofuels, and blue hydrogen. ⁸¹ The activities of the traditional IOCs in 2022–23 have generally remained consistent with their priorities in 2021. The portfolio concentration eﬀorts of these companies exhibit a pattern of divestment and new investment not that diﬀerent from the \u0000rst movers, although r e\u0000ecting diﬀerent causes and involving diﬀerent assets. ExxonMobil and Chevron have exited assets in Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia that are distant from their home jurisdictions, while focusing new investment within the United States and friendly Western Hemisphere geographies, such as Guyana. More speci\u0000cally, ExxonMobil departed Russia, where it operated the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project on behalf of a multinational consortium, in 2022, and the company also has now sold (or is in the process of selling) assets in Cameroon, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, and Nigeria. Chevron, similarly, has sold projects in the UK and Denmark"}

ExxonMobil has invested heavily in the Permian Basin, which accounted for half of its US oil and gas production in 2022 and where company production is slated to reach 1 MMb/d by 2027, and in gr een\u0000eld oil and gas development in oﬀshore Guyana. Favorable development terms in the latter country, which had no previous history as an oil producer, enabled Exxon to move from deepwater discovery (2015) to \u0000rst production (2019) in less than half a decade. Over 25 signi\u0000cant petroleum discoveries have now been registered. Chevron, similarly, has concentrated new investment in the Permian Basin and related shale assets (a projected 30% of 2023 capex) and oﬀshore Gulf of Mexico (20%). On 22 May 2023, Chevron expanded its shale holdings by acquiring shale producer PDC Energy, with assets adjacent to existing Chevron properties in the Denver-Julesburg and Permian basins. ⁸⁴ Chevron's investments in the oﬀshore Gulf of Mexico are devoted to advancing projects such as its operated Ballymore tieback, the Anchor hub development, and the St. Malo Stage 4 water \u0000ood scheme. The company's signature project to develop the Jack and St. Malo \u0000elds is expected to yield more than 500 million oil-equivalent barrels over the project lifetime. Re\u0000ecting the strengthened commitment to capital discipline, E&P budgets for 2023—$23–25 billion for ExxonMobil, $17 billion for Chevron— are greater than for 2022, but smaller than what was projected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Clean- energy spending as a share of overall capital spending by the traditional IOCs is much lower than for the \u0000rst movers. ExxonMobil, for example, plans to spend $17 billion on low- carbon activities in 2022–27, up from previous targets of $15 billion and compared with the $10 billion invested during 2000–20. However, S&P Global estimates that low-carbon spending by the company only amounts to 4% of total corporate spending in 2022, rising to 18% by 2027. ⁸⁵ This is considerably lower than the average low-carbon spending of a \"peer group\" of seven IOCs (BP, Chevron, Eni, Equinor, ExxonMobil, Shell, and T otalEnergies), of 12% and 25% for 2022 and 2027, respectively. Similarly, Chevron has budgeted only 8% of total corporate spending for low-carbon investments by 2025. ⁸⁶ Unlike the renewable power–focused clean-energy spending undertaken by the \u0000rst movers, most low-carbon spending by ExxonMobil and Chevron is focused on lowering emissions in their own operations and leveraging existing competencies—CCUS, blue hydrogen, and biofuels (see Figure 2.3 Global integrated oil companies: Current low-carbon strategies). 2.7.3 NOCs The national oil companies' approach to the energy transition is strongly in\u0000uenced by their role as stewards of their respective countries' national hydrocarbon wealth. With substantial state ownership, they operate as agents of state policy and are less 80 https://www.ft.com/content/a5d7b2e5-fe13-481d-88a4-de9e66171fad; https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shell-boost-dividend-cut- spending-new-ceo-plan-2023-06-14/. 81 ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Imperial all have net-zero pledges for Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050. The \u0000rst movers made similar net-zero Scope 1 and 2 pledges. BP, Eni, and Galp pledged net-zero Scope 3 emissions by 2050, while T otalEnergies targeted a 40% reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2030. 82 The Economist , 11 February 2023, pp. 57–58. 83 S&P Global Commodity Insights, Companies & Transactions, SEAM Alert—Upstream: Chevron rumored to divest Republic of Congo and Angola/Congo unitized area assets , 23 June 2023. 84 https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/chevron-buy-pdc-energy-76-billion- 2023-05-22/. 85 S&P Global Commodity Insights, Low-Carbon Company Prole: ExxonMobil , May 2023. 86 S&P Global Commodity Insights, Low-Carbon Company Prole: Chevron , September 2022.

In 2022–23, r e\u0000ecting these priorities, the NOCs as a group allocated less than 5% of their total capex to clean-energy initiatives. ⁸⁹ Yet the ability of an NOC to diversify its portfolio and invest in non-petroleum (including clean-energy) activities varies widely by country, depending on how much revenue the NOC brings in and the extent to which the national government depends on oil and gas revenues to drive economic growth (Figure 2.4).⁹⁰ Among NOCs—and excluding the anomalous Equinor, as mentioned above—PETRONAS is perhaps the most aggressive company pursuing low carbon as a stand-alone business strategy. In 2022, the Malaysian NOC created the Gentari subsidiary, which is targeting 30–40 GW of renewable energy capacity, 1.2 MMt per year of green and blue hydrogen capacity, and about 25,000 charging stations in the Asia P aci\u0000c region. ⁹¹ Other NOCs, such as Aramco, ADNOC (UAE), CNPC and Sinopec (China), YDP (Argentina), and PTT (Thailand) have made substantial investments in wind or solar power, and still others (ADNOC, QuatarEnergy, and Aramco) in CCUS and hydrogen. Even those NOCs determined to keep their focus on the petroleum sector (e.g., Venezuela's PDVSA, Nigeria's NNPC, and Mexico's Pemex) are having to adapt as pressure increases to address climate change. NOCs are increasingly redoubling eﬀorts to decarbonize their existing activities, to improve their public image and ensure that they maintain a \"social license\" as responsible actors to operate in the oil and gas sphere. This includes signi\u0000cant investments to curtail upstream greenhouse 88 This was precisely the plan of action announced by the NOCs of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Iraq, Libya, Argentina, Colombia, and Brazil during the high price environment that had emerged in late 2021 ( New York Times , 15 October 2021). And the United Arab Emirates' Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) has announced that it will bring forward its ambitious 5 MMb/d (245 Mt/year) oil production capacity target from 2030 to 2027 to meet what it expects to be rising medium-term global oil demand. 89 The Economist , 30 July 2022. 90 The \"operational div ersi\u0000cation\" score depicted in the \u0000gure measures the degree to which NOCs have moved to expand their business activities into nonpetroleum spheres in the energy sector: hydrogen, wind power, solar power, biofuels, geothermal, hydropower, other energy infrastructure, and investments outside energy suﬃcient to constitute a standalone business. NOCs were assigned a binary score (0 or 1) on the basis of their existing research focus, announced business development strategies, and existing investments in the relevant energy segment; a score of 1 indicates an actual committed investment in that energy source, whereas a score of 0 r e\u0000ects an absence of investment (NOCs with announced plans for investments received a score of 0.5). The aggregate score across all categories then r e\u0000ects the NOC's \"degree of operational div ersi\u0000cation\" rating ( NOC Insights, p. 6). 91 S&P Global Commodity Insights, IHS Herold, Five Key Questions for National Oil Companies in 2023 , January 2023, p. 7.

Finally, for small NOCs with limited \u0000nancial resources, it is increasingly important to \u0000nd outside partners—both to fund new clean-energy investments as well as to bolster oil and gas capex to increase their operational capability to monetize domestic petroleum assets within the energy transition timeline. Enabling both types of investment will require the host country to set attractive terms for the participation of foreign partners in upstream development. Kazakhstan's national company KMG already has established a good foundation for foreign investment and cooperation with major international oil companies through its participation in the international consortia developing Kazakhstan's \"Big 3\" oil and gas mega-projects.

Falling coal output accounts for most of the expected drop in primary energy output during this period (a 2.1% average annual rate of decline, versus a 0.6% annual decline rate for oil) (see Figure 2.6 Outlook for Kazakhstan's primary energy production by fuel to 2050). Kazakhstan’s apparent primary energy consumption remained almost unchanged in 2022 from the previous year, at 93.5 MMtoe. Primary electricity consumption, boosted by the increase in renewable energy, increased by 30.4% (to 3.0 MMtoe), albeit from a small base, and natural gas consumption grew by 5.2% (to 26.4 MMtoe). Longer term, our outlook is for total apparent primary energy demand to remain essentially \u0000at over the 2023-50 period, re\u0000ecting further improvements in aggregate energy eﬃciency that oﬀset the underlying growth in economic activity. But demand trends diverge widely by fuel type: natural gas consumption is expected to grow modestly (by 0.7% annually to 32.3 MMtoe), while we expect demand to grow even more sharply in percentage terms for primary electricity (up 4.5% annually to 10.3 MMtoe); oil demand also remains on a relatively strong growth path (rising by 1.3% annually, to 24.3 MMtoe), while coal consumption falls substantially during the outlook period (dropping by 1.9% annually to 27.6 M Мtoe). A key driver of the changes in the fuel mix to 2050 is the gradual displacement of coal in the power sector, primarily by natural gas along with expansion of renewables and eventually nuclear energy. Aggregate gas consumption growth is muted by eﬃciency gains, so consumption does not expand as quickly as in the earlier periods.

The main factors were disruptions in production and exports of oil owing to the Russia- Ukraine armed con\u0000ict. T otal primary energy exports as a share of primary energy production fell from 51.6% in 2020 to 48.6% in 2021, and then to 48.2% in 2022. Our primary energy balance projections show this trend continuing, with the share of production consumed domestically increasing from 51.8% in 2022 to 64.2% in 2050 (see Figure 2.5 Kazakhstan's primary energy balance: historical and outlook to 2050). The implication is that while energy exports will continue to play an important role in the country's economy, slowly declining energy production and rising domestic energy consumption will eventually reduce net primary energy exports substantially, by roughly half (to 52.5 MMtoe) by 2050. T otal production of primary energy in Kazakhstan, which includes oil, gas, coal, and primary electricity (but not mined uranium), fell by 0.9% in 2022 to 180.6 MMtoe. Increases in primary electricity production (i.e., hydro and renewables, by 8.9% to 2.7 MMtoe) and coal (by 1.3% to 64.3 MMtoe) failed to oﬀset declines in oil (-1.9% to 84.2 MMtoe) and gas (-2.6% to 29.4 MMtoe). The 2022 drop in total primary energy production followed a shallow post- pandemic recovery in 2021 (0.4% to 182.3 MMtoe). We expect a return to growth in primary energy production in 2023, by 2.7% to 185.5 MMtoe, led by a rebound in oil and in gas production. Subsequently, primary energy production is expected peak at 200.3 MMtoe in 2026, after which output steadily declines, to Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global.Coal Oil Natural gas Primary electricity Other (peat, wood, etc.) 100120140160180200 020406080 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2040 2050 2045 2035 Figure 2.6 Outlook for Kazakhstan's primary energy production by fuel to 2050 (MМtoe) 60 potential for growth during the outlook period; electricity generated by wind stations almost matches hydroelectricity generation at the end of the outlook period, reaching 18.6 billion kWh in 2050 (about 13% of total generation). We also envision the addition of nuclear power to the electricity fuel mix during the outlook period, starting in the mid-2030s, but its share of generation remains relatively small in 2050 at around 6%, similar to the share of solar (see Figure 2.7 Outlook for Kazakhstan's primary energy consumption by fuel to 2050). Despite its smaller role in 2050, coal can provide an important \"energy security blanket\" for Kazakhstan during the energy transition. Kazakhstan's indigenous coal is low-cost to produce and is readily available in large quantities, and does not require new or imported technologies to produce or deliver to consumers. Although a major drawback is its high carbon- intensity, as Kazakhstan shifts to cleaner fuels that are either imported (natural gas) or higher cost or dependent on imported technologies and equipment (solar, wind, hydrogen), low-cost indigenous coal (even as its use winds down) can serve as an important stabilizer or anchor in oﬀsetting the inherent risks posed by these other energy sources to availability and aﬀordability. And where coal consumption is necessary, a number of technologies can be employed during its extraction and combustion to increase the eﬃciency of its extraction and use, and reduce harmful emissions—ultra-supercritical steam cycle generation and integrated ga si\u0000cation combined cycle generation in electric power production, CCUS in power generation and industry, and the use of best-available technologies (BAT) to reduce methane emissions during coal mining. ⁹² Kazakhstan's net primary energy exports in 2022 (87.1 MMtoe) increased slightly relative to 2021, but remained below the immediate pre-pandemic level of 94.2 MMtoe achieved in 2019. Kazakhstan's net exports of oil and oil products, which accounted for 77.2% of total net primary energy exports in 2022, declined slightly in 2022, by 0.6% to 67.2 MMtoe, as market disruptions following the onset of armed con\u0000ict in Ukraine unsettled oil markets. Net exports of gas (primarily to China) contracted more sharply in 2022 by 43.1% to 2.9 MMtoe, as domestic consumption increased. Conversely, net exports of coal increased modestly, as a result of higher demand in Europe as the EU and UK banned imports of Russian coal. S&P Global expects net exports of coal to continue to contract over time as the energy transition takes hold more \u0000rmly globally. Overall net primary energy exports are expected to reach a maximum of 109.1 MMtoe in 2025. Subsequently they trend downward over the outlook period, declining to 52.5 MMtoe in 2050. This r e\u0000ects the anticipated longer-term drop in nearly all fuels—oil, gas, and coal—while net exports of (primary) electricity remain negligible. Coal exports diminish to 7.8 MMtoe in 2050, while net exports of oil and petroleum products contract to 47.8 MMtoe in 2050. Kazakhstan switches from being a net gas exporter to a net gas importer in the 2040s. This r e\u0000ects our assumptions of increased gas demand (due in part to accelerated coal-to-gas switching in the power sector) and relatively \u0000at commercial Kazakh gas production longer term.

But these measures should be implemented in such a way that they do not worsen the investment environment for both low-carbon as well as traditional energy sources and technologies that are vital for overall energy supply and the transition to cleaner and more resilient energy systems. ⁹⁴ More speci\u0000cally, global experience strongly indicates that the most eﬀective way for government to help people impacted by high energy prices is not to reduce or cap prices by administrative means, but rather to explore ways of helping consumers access alternative low-cost energy sources (when choices are available), use energy more eﬃciently, and through temporary measures such as releasing emergency fuel reserves or suspending or reducing fuel taxes. Price ceilings do little to reduce energy consumption or expand supply, and market pricing plays a strong role in curbing excessive demand and allocating the various sources of energy to their most important and eﬀective (\"highest value\") uses in the economy. Listed below are various strategies Kazakh energy policymakers might consider when attempting to reduce the level of subsidization of energy prices throughout the economy, while at the same time avoiding major disruption for both producers and consumers and mitigating public opposition: ► Diﬀerentiated prices, with higher rates being applied to large consumers to more eﬀectively incentivize conservation and eﬃciency measures ► Stepping up cross-border energy trade to expand supply and potentially reduce overall costs, particularly if imports are cheaper than domestic production (e.g., natural gas, diesel) ► Implement targeted direct subsidies, limited to the lowest- income households, in the form of direct \u0000nancial assistance to pay utility bills or \u0000nance home energy eﬃciency retr o\u0000ts. Subsidies that protect the poorest \u0000fth of the population in some European countries are estimated to cost only about 0.4% of GDP, and the poorest two -\u0000fths of the population, 0.9%. ⁹⁵ ► Implement energy eﬃciency programs to reduce electric power consumption by households and businesses; these can include incentives or credits for energy-saving renovations and the purchase of newer, more eﬃcient appliances, and conducting home and business energy audits ► Launch public awareness campaigns to inform consumers about the appropriate use of electricity and other energy sources and the bene \u0000ts of adopting energy-eﬃcient practices ► Temporarily reduce or suspend excise taxes on rened products. This approach was widely employed (e.g., in Europe, Australia, and some state governments in the United States) in 2022 during the period of high energy prices. ⁹⁶ ► Implement selective conservation regulations, such as prohibitions or mandatory reductions in electricity use (e.g., in business or street lighting during non-business hours) and adjustments to heating and/or cooling levels in public buildings ► Releases from national fuel reserves. For speci\u0000c situations, a release of crude oil and r e\u0000ned products from national petroleum reserves may be necessary to mitigate high energy prices.

The move followed a similar announcement by the United States of an emergency 180 MMb release from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This strategy, however, is now complicated by the fact that these reserves will need to be replenished by purchases at higher prices as a result of recent supply management policies instituted by OPEC+. Another typical action during periods of high energy prices is to simply tax the windfall pr o\u0000ts of the energy companies (often aimed at providing funds for governments to cover other subsidy or support programs). However, a broader societal response to high energy prices would seem more prudent. Windfall taxes on energy producers are undesirable if the primary outcome simply becomes underinvestment in capacity and supply (e.g., upstream exploration and production), accentuating the boom and bust of the commodities cycle and leading to future rounds of high energy prices. 2.10 High-Level Takeaways An eﬀective energy security strategy for Kazakhstan is one that meets domestic energy needs, keeps energy aﬀordable and widely available to consumers, and also makes material progress toward"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_NationalReport23_en_44", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\NationalReport23_en.pdf", "text": "a cleaner energy future. Regardless of whether Kazakhstan (or any other country) meets its emissions reduction and net-zero pledges precisely and on schedule, it is important to continue making progress while meeting the diverse energy needs of its population and businesses. This requires an approach that ensures national energy security is based on the principle of an optimal combination of traditional and renewable sources of primary energy at the national level. While far from constituting a fully formed, articulated energy security strategy, we can identify important elements of such a strategy. ► In order to achieve policy resilience, Kazakhstan’s energy sector ultimately needs to function within a broader market- economy framework, allowing market supply and demand fundamentals to drive prices and allocate resources. Demonopolization may be needed in certain segments and activities to allow market forces to operate eﬀectively. In other sectors, notably the natural monopolies or networked sectors, more eﬀective and \u0000exible regulatory approaches are needed for market forces to function. ► Kazakhstan should adopt a general open-trade stance internationally with respect to energy, to drive greater eﬃciency and market-oriented prices. As such, this entails general acquiescence to the emerging EAEU free-trade regime, although care should be exercised to balance the bene\u0000ts of integration with Kazakhstan's domestic energy security needs. These issues are addressed in greater detail in Chapter 3. ► Policymakers should seek to limit state participation in domestic energy markets, intervening selectively and judiciously only when necessary to alleviate obvious market shortcomings or achieve speci\u0000c policy goals. ► The role of coal in the domestic economy should be reduced, but carefully and gradually; this low-cost, domestically available fuel provides essential ballast for the greater risks involved in the other elements of the overall energy transition. ► Natural gas is one of the cheapest and most eﬀective fuels for decarbonization over the next 1-2 decades; its role in the economy needs to be expanded, even if doing so increases overall reliance on imports to achieve wider penetration. However, careful planning should be devoted to its allocation for various uses, to reduce the potential for wasteful consumption and to avoid disruptions for the economy and the population (pricing). ► When increasing the role of renewables in electricity generation, caution should be exercised in its pace in order to maintain system reliability and general aﬀordability of electricity for consumers; this may require a revamping of the existing support scheme (see the Chapter on electric power). ► The reliability of the existing grid should also be enhanced through targeted investment to ensure uninterrupted and expanded power supplies for both consumers and industry from infrastructure already in place; existing facilities can contribute signi\u0000cantly to the goal of greater elec tri\u0000cation during the transition period while renewable generation reaches its full potential. ► Energy security for Kazakhstan needs to be enhanced by diversifying export routes for crude oil, to reduce the overall risk of adverse developments occurring on any single route or in any single export market. ► Kazakhstan's energy security actions also should extend to maintaining diversity among investor-countries and investor- types in foreign direct investment in the energy sector; consequently, this entails creating and maintaining an attractive investment environment given increased global competition for this type of \u0000nancing. 2.10.1 A national energy security strategy for the Republic of Kazakhstan Given the outsized and increasing importance of the energy complex in Kazakhstan's economy, a national policy priority should be the drafting and codi\u0000cation of an energy security strategy (Energy Security Strategy of the Republic of Kazakhstan to 2050) as one of the foundational state planning documents. As a formal Strategy, it will unite existing concepts in the \u0000elds of energy, environment, subsoil use, etc. within one document and inform and in\u0000uence the formation of strategic plans of all government bodies, so that the strategic directions of various government agencies involving energy security are coordinated and harmonized. By eliminating the friction between contradictory state energy policies—some which seek to maximize energy production and others which aim to curb consumption (energy saving)—the harmonization of existing concepts will ultimately have a synergistic eﬀect, strengthening energy security. KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY 63 Such a strategy will need to be dynamic or evolving—rather than static or \u0000xed—given the \u0000uid nature of both the global geopolitical environment and the domestic scene. The Strategy will need to \u0000exibly respond to changing conditions in order to maintain a proper balance between energy, the national economy, and the well-being of the environment and population. Importantly, it also must be focused on the speci\u0000c needs of Kazakhstan, as each country faces its own speci\u0000c energy security challenges. An energy security strategy for Kazakhstan must address the following key energy vulnerabilities: ► The high concentration (over 95% in 2022) of Kazakhstan's crude oil exports that transit a third country (Russia) to reach world markets, and the high percentage of total exports (82%) exported along a single pipeline—the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline route. ► An electric power system with a relatively high level of wear and tear, much of it installed over four decades ago, which is increasingly susceptible to outages and has received inadequate investment for many years. ► Insuﬃcient strategic fuel storage capacity. Operational (\"everyday\") crude oil storage capacity in Kazakhstan presently appears adequate to cover domestic r e\u0000nery needs in the event of a short-term disruption to regular supply; however, strategic storage capacity must be added to oﬀset sudden and unexpected reductions in export demand or export capacity (pipelines). Re \u0000neries have operational storage for \u0000nished products, but these volumes are relatively small, particularly for products in high demand (e.g., diesel, A- 95 gasoline). Additional strategic storage capacity is needed to avoid r e\u0000nery shutdowns due to unforeseen events. The country's natural gas storage capacity, although presently adequate to meet some three months of 2022-level domestic consumption, will nonetheless need to be expanded in light of projected future increases in domestic gas consumption. ► The need to ensure div ersi\u0000cation of future natural gas imports, as the country gradually shifts toward"}

KAZAKHSTAN'S ENERGY SECURITY ► The looming energy security challenge from the build-out of intermittent renewable generation capacity, which will test system resilience and put a premium on reliable reserve baseload capacity, including from coal. ► The need to increase investments in energy R&D and training of personnel. The report should follow a process that would enable the identi\u0000cation of concrete steps Kazakhstan could take to address these vulnerabilities. Such a process would include: ► A comprehensive assessment of the country's \"margin of safety\" for speci\u0000c energy commodities. Calculation of the margin of safety would be based on an evaluation of geological reserves, state balance data, and forecasts for production and consumption of basic energy resources (oil, gas, electricity). ► The margin of safety would provide a measure of how many days supplies of energy would be available in suﬃcient quantity in the event of an unforeseen event in the world or in neighboring countries that would necessitate, in an extreme case, the closure of Kazakhstan's borders or the declaration of a state-wide emergency. ► Identi\u0000cation of key gaps in the margin of safety for particular energy commodities (e.g., less than a 10- or 30-day supply) that would require studies to recommend measures Kazakh authorities should undertake to achieve a secure energy supply: (a) for a period of up to one year for strategically important state services (e.g., Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs, Ministry of Emergency Situations, doctors, \u0000re\u0000ghters, Ministry of Defense); and (b) for a shorter period for the population more generally. ► These measures might include, but would not be limited to: o Construction of storage depots for strategic reserves of crude oil and petroleum products (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel) o Construction of additional gas storage capacity, with identi\u0000cation of the optimal types (underground, other) and location of facilities o Further development of the Laws on Emergency Situations and Civil Protection to enhance energy security o Options for providing additional backup power sources at electric power plants, which might include each strategic plant or facility having its own fuel-powered generators for uninterrupted operation or each region having its own autonomous source of energy storage o Options for replacement of gas with renewable energy, with identi \u0000cation of the most available renewable resources available for the task. 64 EURASIAN ENERGY COOPERATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION 3. EURASIAN ENERGY COOPERATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION 3.1 Key Points ► Member-states of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) are pursuing speci\u0000c programs to harmonize their energy policies that are anticipated to result in a “Single Market” (i.e., unitary markets across the territory of the EAEU) for oil/re \u0000ned products, natural gas, and electricity by 2025. Although energy policy harmonization is being implemented in many areas, two are expected to have the greatest impact on energy consumers and producers in Kazakhstan—energy pricing and energy transit. ► Within the EAEU framework, the right of non-national companies to access the pipeline system of another EAEU member-state looks like it is going to be governed by the access regime the latter has adopted for its own producers of a speci\u0000c energy commodity (not aﬃliated with the owner of the pipeline infrastructure) under its domestic law. In the case of crude oil transit via Russia, extant Russian legislation recognizes the right of all domestic oil producers to non-discriminatory third-party access for both domestic and export sales, simply paying an established tariﬀ. Thus, non-Russian producers can utilize the Transneft system to export crude beyond Russia as well, and have been doing so for many years. Given the reduction in Russian pipeline crude exports to Europe following the start of armed con\u0000ict in Ukraine, capacity now exists for Kazakh oil along certain routes in the Transneft system that did not exist previously, such as for Kazakh exports of its crude (now rebranded as Kazakh export blend crude oil [KEBCO]) to Germany via the northern Druzhba pipeline, which commenced on 20 February 2023 and is now running at about 100,000 tons per month. ► The issue of pricing of oil and r e\u0000ned products poses a greater challenge for Kazakhstan with the formation of a Single Market. Despite the Government of Kazakhstan's commitment to general price liberalization and market parity, r e\u0000ned product prices in Kazakhstan remain heavily administered and have been kept below (sometimes substantially) those in fellow EAEU member- states. Ar ti\u0000cially low prices disincentivize producers to supply the domestic market and lead to the unauthorized/undocumen - ted out \u0000ow of Kazakh r e\u0000ned products (especially in border regions) to neighboring states. Price parity between Kazakhstan and its neighbors will need to be achieved primarily by economic measures, such as open market trading via exchanges or liberalizing exports and imports. Despite challenges in the area of price harmonization, progress is evident in three areas: excise tax harmonization, coordinated EAEU actions to curb unauthorized (“grey”) exports, and exchange trading. ► Unlike the situation with oil, the issue of gas transit (and gas transportation tariﬀs) has proven to be a major sticking point for EAEU harmonization eﬀorts. One key issue is whether a"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_NationalReport23_en_46", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\NationalReport23_en.pdf", "text": "uniform gas transportation tariﬀ should be set across the entire EAEU economic space or whether the individual EAEU member-states should set their own tariﬀs applicable within their own borders, but would apply equally to all gas shipped regardless of national origin or individual shipper. The major gas importer-countries are in favor of a uniform tariﬀ (basically on par with average tariﬀs in Russia) across the entire EAEU space, whereas Russia—the main gas supplier within the EAEU—is reluctant, as diﬀerentiated tariﬀs within its borders allow for substantial cross-subsidization to occur between long-haul and short-haul shipments within its borders and between export and domestic shipments. The Russians believe such a uniform EAEU tariﬀ would amount to the subsidization by Russia of the gas transportation charges that would be paid by shippers of other member-states. ► A second transit-related issue involves third-party access to Russia's gas pipeline network. Although Russia has allowed gas produced in other states to access its gas pipeline network, such access has been highly restricted, usually to gas that has been purchased by Gazprom for onward delivery or through Gazprom-aﬃliated entities. No non-Russian producer/shipper has been allowed to directly deliver gas to Russian consumers. Under the evolving EAEU rules, non-Russian suppliers would have to be given the same access to pipelines and consumers as Russian “independent” gas producers now have. Furthermore, the Russian Law on Gas Export (2006) grants Gazprom monopoly access to the pipeline system on its territory for exports, thus precluding any export possibilities for other Russian gas producers. Under the EAEU rules, such export access is therefore similarly denied to gas producers in other EAEU member-states (e.g., Kazakhstan). ► The challenges faced by Kazakhstan in harmonizing its domestic natural gas prices with those of other EAEU member- states in the run-up to the Single Market in gas are similar to those in the oil and r e\u0000ned products market. Kazakhstan's end-user gas prices are among the lowest among EAEU members, and therefore have “the farthest to go” in terms of price harmoniza- tion. The potential bene\u0000ts of a Single Market for gas, as it is currently taking shape, for Kazakhstan—essentially a competing gas producer to Russia—are much less clear than for the gas- importing EAEU member states, especially if access to export markets beyond Russia is essentially precluded. But Kazakhstan does appear to be transitioning to become a larger importer of Russian gas in the future, so the balance may be tipping. ► A major conceptual foundation for the Single Market in electric power is that there will be no supranational EAEU electricity market—existing national electricity markets, including capacity markets, will be maintained—but instead a system of closely integrated national markets will be employed, but operating across national borders in the areas of electricity trade, access to services, interstate power transfers, and information sharing. Substantive progress has been reported in such areas as measurement of interstate electricity balances, (load) compensa- tion, and electricity trading (via free bilateral contracts, \u0000xed term contracts, and 24-hour trade contracts) on three exchanges (St. Petersburg International Mercantile Exchange, Belarusian Universal Trade Exchange, and the Kazakhstan Electricity and Capacity Market Operator). The impacts of the Single Market on Kazakh domestic electricity prices would therefore appear to be limited by the fact that electricity trading will take the form of \u0000xed-term contracts between the designated national power EURASIAN ENERGY COOPERATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION 66 companies of the respective countries, rather than multitudinous transactions between individual producers and consumers of electricity. ► Broad Central Asian cooperation in energy markets and infrastructure to date has been delayed by historical diﬀerences over other issues such as water rights and territorial disputes involving Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan—a legacy of Soviet-era boundary delineations. Such diﬀerences are not immutable, as evidenced by recent agreements oﬃcially resolving Uzbekistan's border claims with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Progress in these areas will pave the way for joint infrastructure projects such as the proposed China-Kyrgyzstan- Uzbekistan Railway, creating momentum (and an improving political environment) that could eventually manifest in a broader regional energy trade framework. ► A key prerequisite for joint Central Asian energy projects is \u0000nancing for investment. The limited \u0000nancial resources of the individual Central Asian countries appear to have constrained the number and scale of bilateral energy system projects between them to date. Rather than agreements between individual Central Asian countries on the development of energy infrastructure, the bulk of bilateral energy projects in the region instead has involved cooperation with larger, wealthier neighbors such as China, Russia, and UAE. In recent years, China has been the most active energy-sector investor in the region, with that country's \u0000nancing and joint projects for infrastructure development \u0000tting squarely within the “One Belt, One Road” framework of its foreign economic policy. Russian companies also have been actively involved in the region for many years, although concerns over access to international \u0000nancing, oil\u0000eld services, and parts for equipment at joint projects are emblematic of the new more challenging operating environment for Russian companies in the region in 2023. 3.2 Creation of Single Energy Markets within the Eurasian Economic Union Foreshadows Important Changes in Domestic Pricing in Kazakhstan and Reorientation of Interstate Energy Trade Kazakhstan is one of the founding members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), an economic bloc established in 2015 that also includes Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia as full members. As noted on its oﬃcial website, the EAEU “provides for free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor [and] pursues coordinated, harmonized, and single policy in the sectors determined by the [Union] Treaty and international agreements within the Union.”¹ Among the most important sectors targeted for integration is energy, for which the member-states are pursuing speci\u0000c programs to harmonize their energy policies that are anticipated to result in “Single Markets” (i.e., unitary markets across the territory of the EAEU member-states) for oil/re \u0000ned products, natural gas, and electricity by 2025. ² Although energy policy harmonization is being implemented in many areas, two are expected to have the greatest impact on"}

Because diﬀerent pricing considerations and rules regulating transit will prevail in the Single Market for each energy commodity, each one is discussed separately below. And because analysis of the general price outlook for the diﬀerent commodities/markets already has been undertaken in the previous National Energy Report (2021)—and our general assessment today remains essentially the same—we will only summarize key pricing issues in this chapter while focusing more heavily on developments aﬀecting energy transit.³ 3.2.1 Oil and oil products Crude oil and the r e\u0000ned products derived from its processing are by far the most valuable energy commodities produced in Kazakhstan in terms of overall revenues, the most \u0000exible in terms of their applications, and the most transportable (r e\u0000ecting the relative relationship between value per unit and transport cost). Consequently, it is not surprising that Kazakh policymakers will be especially vigilant about crude and products pricing and terms of transit as EAEU energy-sector integration proceeds. Integration toward the Single Market in oil/products has proceeded in stages. The \u0000rst stage, completed in December 2018, involved agreement on the EAEU's common oil and r e\u0000ned products markets formation Program and its approval by the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council (consisting of the leaders of the \u0000ve EAEU member-states). The second phase, currently in progress and scheduled to be completed this year, involves implementation of the steps stipulated in the Program, including development of uni\u0000ed rules governing (a) access to oil and re\u0000ned products transportation systems and (b) general and exchange trading of oil and products in member-states. The third phase, to be completed in 2024, would \u0000nalize formation of the EAEU common oil and r e\u0000ned products market, culminating in a formal Treaty on 1 January 2025. 3.2.1.1 Transit Unlike the situation concerning natural gas (discussed below) negotiations concerning Kazakhstan's access to Transneft's pipeline system in Russia for crude exports beyond Russia (i.e., using Russia as a transit country) has not proved particularly contentious. ⁴ The general principle regarding pipeline access for both crude/products (and natural gas) Single Market is as follows: The right of non-national companies to access the pipeline system of another EAEU member-state is governed by the access regime the latter has adopted for its own producers of a speci\u0000c energy commodity (not aﬃliated with the owner of the pipeline 1 http://www.eaeunion.org/?lang=en#about. 2 Currently the energy trade among the EAEU countries is governed mostly by special bilateral trade agreements that cover volumes and terms, pricing, and other issues, such as export duties. 3 For a detailed discussion of energy pricing issues surrounding the creation of these Single Markets, see Kazakhstan Association of Oil & Gas and Energy Sector Organizations KAZENERGY, The National Energy Report 2021, pp. 109–112, 137–138, and 177–181. 4 Use of Russian products pipelines to transit non-Russian exports to non-EAEU countries is similarly guaranteed, but has not proven much of an issue in reality, given the small volumes and types of r e\u0000ned products Kazakhstan exports to such markets via Russia as well as the general geography and lay-out of Russia's re\u0000ned products pipeline system.EURASIAN ENERGY COOPERATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION 67 infrastructure) under its domestic law. In the case of crude oil, extant Russian legislation recognizes the right of all domestic independent oil producers to non-discriminatory third-party access for both domestic and export sales, simply paying an established tariﬀ. Thus, non-Russian producers (both independ- ents and national companies) can utilize the Transneft system to export crude beyond Russia as well, and have been doing so for many years. And in fact, the situation since 2022 seems to be reinforcing this existing acquis: Given the reduction in Russian pipeline crude exports to Europe, capacity now exists for Kazakh oil along certain routes in the Transneft system that did not exist previously, such as for Kazakh exports of its crude (now rebranded as Kazakh export blend crude oil [KEBCO]) to Germany via the northern Druzhba pipeline, which commenced on 20 February 2023 and is now running at about 100,000 tons per month.⁵ Similarly, Kazakhstan has been transiting Russian crude oil to mainland China across Kazakh territory via the KTO pipeline system and the Kazakhstan-China oil pipeline since 2014. The amount has been running at about 10 MMt/y. 3.2.1.2 Pricing Rather it is the issue of pricing that poses a greater challenge for Kazakhstan with the formation of the Single Market. Despite the Government of Kazakhstan's commitment to general price liberalization and market parity, re \u0000ned product prices in Kazakhstan remain heavily administered and have been kept below (sometimes substantially) those in fellow EAEU member- states. The social goal of supplying low-cost fuel to retail customers in the domestic market clearly has been a high political priority, but has several negative economic consequences: ► It disincentivizes Kazakh crude producers (who subsidize arti\u0000cially low retail prices through crude oil sales at prices well below world market levels) and r e\u0000ners and wholesalers (who receive an extremely limited retail margin) to supply the domestic market. ► It raises energy security issues, leading to the unautho- rized/undocumented out \u0000ow of Kazakh r e\u0000ned products (especially in border regions) into neighboring countries (e.g., Russia, Kyrgyzstan), where prices are signi\u0000cantly higher (so- called “grey exports”). ► Another energy security issue arising from integration is the role of Russian-manufactured re \u0000ned products in the domestic market. Under the Single Market, Russian r e\u0000ners, which have ample production capacity, would have unfettered access to Kazakhstan's consumers, potentially displacing Kazakhstan's own products in certain market segments or geographies.Eﬀorts to address these problems through temporary administrative measures (bans on all exports, limits on the amount that can be purchased, or diﬀerentiated pricing, for example) provide temporary relief yet do not really solve the underlying issue, which is the temptation to move products across borders to achieve lower prices or higher margins, rather than supply domestic consumers. Rather, price parity between Kazakhstan and its neighbors will need to be achieved primarily by economic measures, such as open market trading via"}

As shall be discussed in some detail in Chapter 5, Kazakhstan is now embarking on product price liberalization, and further liberalization of domestic prices will nevertheless be needed to achieve the Single Market goals of price harmonization across the EAEU economic space. As we observed in The National Energy Report 2021, Kazakhstan will need to adjust its domestic pricing policies more than any other EAEU member in order to achieve this goal, because Kazakhstan has the lowest retail gasoline and diesel prices among the \u0000ve EAEU nations (see Figure 3.1 Average retail prices of A-92 gasoline in selected EAEU countries, and Figure 3.2 Average retail prices of diesel in selected EAEU countries). Kazakhstan's lower prices within the EAEU r e\u0000ect its unique position vis-à-vis Russia relative to the other EAEU member states. As a net oil and gas exporter, depending primarily on energy exports to global markets, Kazakhstan directly competes with, rather than complements, Russia. In contrast, the trade structure of the remaining EAEU members, which mainly import Russian energy commodities, is already oriented more strongly toward the economic space of Russia (and Russian pricing). This facilitates their EAEU market harmonization, as they already operate largely according to Russia's general acquis. Given Russia's vastly greater size and economic weight—accounting for 79% of the bloc's population, 86% of its oil output, and 85% of its aggregate GDP—oil prices under any harmonization scenario will inexorably gravitate toward those prevailing in Russia. And indeed, in recent months, policymakers at KREM and the Ministry of Energy have increased domestic retail price limits for motor fuels. ⁶ On 12 April 2023, the maximum retail price of A-92 gasoline rose to 205 tenge/liter from 182 tenge, and diesel fuel to 295 tenge/liter from 230–260 tenge, depending on the region. This, in turn, has stimulated greater demand for autogas (LPG), widely used as a substitute in motor vehicles. The latter currently averages about 80 tenge/liter in Kazakhstan. In June 2023, the Energy of Ministry announced plans to gradually raise retail LPG prices to a level (120 tenge/liter) at which imports from Russia (where there is a sizable surplus of LPG over domestic consump- tion) would become competitive price-wise domestically, supporting imports if necessary to balance the market.⁷ 6 The Committee for Regulation of Natural Monopolies (KREM) of the Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan is a state body that controls and regulates activities related to the sphere of natural monopolies and socially signi \u0000cant markets. https://www.gov.kz/memleket/entities/krem/about?lang=en. 7 See S&P Global Commodity Insights Strategic Report, An Uphill Struggle: Russia's LPG producers face major new near-term marketing challenges coupled with longer-term feedstock risks, October 2022.5 https://www.reuters.com/article/kazakhstan-oil-exports/update-1- kazakhstan-to-send-100000-t-of-crude-to-germany-via-druzhba-in-may- idUSL1N37L1P2 .EURASIAN ENERGY COOPERATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION 68 Figure 3.1 Average retail prices of A-92 gasoline in selected EAEU countries ($/liter) Figure 3.2 Average retail prices of diesel in selected EAEU countries ($/liter)Source : S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global.

On 24 March 2022, the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan issued Resolution No. 155, which increased excise taxes on gasoline by 10 tenge per liter and on diesel fuel by 20 tenge per liter. This still leaves Kazakhstan's excise taxes at only 39.5% of those in Russia on motor gasoline and 54.2% of those on diesel fuel (see Figure 3.3 Excise Taxes on Re\u0000ned Products in EAEU countries). The move is part of a broader eﬀort to bring taxes on petroleum products in line with those in Russia in concert with ongoing EAEU harmonization. Further changes in taxes on fuels and lubricants are envisioned in the lead-up to the planned launch of the Single Market. On 22 June 2022, the Ministries of Finance, Internal Aﬀairs, and Energy, along with the National Security Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan, issued a joint order prohibiting the export of gasoline, diesel, and certain other r e\u0000ned products via road transport for a six-month period.⁸ Although such product export bans designed to limit smuggling of motor fuels have been fairly common in Kazakhstan in recent decades, the recent ban is harmonized with established EAEU protocols: ► It is based not only on Kazakh legislation but also on Article 29 (and Section 10 of Annex 7) of the EAEU Treaty ► The grades of fuel covered are de\u0000ned according to standard EAEU speci\u0000cations ► The joint order directs the Ministry of Energy to notify Kazakhstan's Ministry of Trade and Integration to report relevant information about the ban to the Eurasian Economic Commission per the EAEU Treaty. 8 Excluded were exports in gas tanks provided by the manufacturer of the motor vehicle, as well as in separate receptacles of no more than 20 liters capacity.EURASIAN ENERGY COOPERATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION Kazakhstan Russian Federation Kyrgyzstan Belarus 69 Figure 3.3 Excise Taxes on Reﬁned Products in Selected EAEU Member-States (%) Source : S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global. Progress in the area of exchange trading (item 35 in the EAEU Program for the oil and products market) is evident in increasing cooperation between Kazakh and Russian exchanges and steps toward the creation of a new commodities trading exchange at the Astana International Financial Center. Kazakhstan's JSC Eurasian Trading System Commodity Exchange (ETSCE; Almaty, Kazakhstan) and Russia's St. Petersburg International Mercantile Exchange (SPIMEX; Russia)—both founded in 2008—have embarked upon several collaborative initiatives in recent years: ► In August 2020, SPIMEX acquired a 5% shareholding in ETSCE. “The transaction was carried out in accordance with the program of inter-exchange cooperation with the bourses of the partner countries as per the agreement on the Eurasian Economic Union” with the stated"}

SPIMEX's experience assists in launching trading of petroleum products, including LPG and jet fuel.”⁹ ► On 9 July 2021, the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC) announced that it would cooperate with ETSCE and its shareholders to develop a commodity exchange (focused on exported commodities) at the AIFC.¹⁰ ► Soon thereafter, on 21 July 2021, the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) held its \u0000rst simulation of an EAEU re\u0000ned products exchange trading session, in collaboration with SPIMEX (over 60 diesel or gasoline transactions were completed). As a result of these and other initiatives designed to stimulate the development of exchange trading, Kazakhstan's Ministry of Energy estimates that the share of exchange trading in petroleum products in Kazakhstan would gradually increase from ~10% of output in 2021–22 to 15–20% by 2024. 3.2.2 Natural gas Work on establishing the EAEU Single Market for natural gas is proceeding on a separate track from the oil/products market; the oﬃcial Programs for both commodities were approved in December 2018 by the EAEU's Supreme Eurasian Economic Council. Under the \u0000rst stage of the Program for gas, the countries formulated key principles for the Single Market and worked to harmonize national legislation where needed. The launch of the second stage of the Program for gas was announced at a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council on 11 December 2020. Work is to focus on development of the infrastructural, technological, and legal foundations of the Single Market, with a particular focus on developing uni\u0000ed rules governing (a) access to natural gas transportation systems and (b) general and exchange trading of natural gas in member-states. The second stage of the Program is to culminate in the rati\u0000cation of an intergovernmental agreement for the Single Market (Intergov- ernmental Treaty on Establishing the Eurasian Economic Union Common Gas Market). A draft of the Treaty was issued by the Eurasian Economic Commission in April 2021, and its details continue to be discussed by member-state representatives, with the goal of its rati\u0000cation sometime in 2023 and its entry into force on 1 January 2025. In the meantime (2023–24) work on the Program's second stage continues. 3.2.2.1 Transit Similar to the situation in the Single Market for oil/products, natural gas pricing is a salient issue across the EAEU's economic space. However, the main factor hindering the harmonization path has been the issue of gas transportation tariﬀs, \u0000rst when the Program for Gas was approved by the Supreme Eurasian 9 https://interfax.com/newsroom/top-stories/69706/. 10 https://aifc.kz/en/news/commodity-exchange-activities-will-be-formed-and- developed-at-the-aifc.Kazakhstan excise taxes as % of Russian excise taxes for motor gasoline Kazakhstan excise taxes as % of Russian excise taxes for diesel fuel Kazakhstan excise taxes as % of Belarusian excise taxes for motor gasoline Kazakhstan excise taxes as % of Belarusian excise taxes for diesel fuel Kazakhstan excise taxes as % of Armenian excise taxes for motor gasoline Kazakhstan excise taxes as % of Armenian excise taxes for diesel fuel 050100150200 Jan-17 Jan-18 Jan-19 Jan-20 Jan-21 Jan-22 Jan-23EURASIAN ENERGY COOPERATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION 70 Economic Council in late 2018 (the decision on transportation tariﬀs was pushed back to a later date) and pushed back further during several subsequent meetings of high-level negotiating bodies in 2020–22. Active eﬀorts to resolve the issue continue to this day, recently at a 16–17 May 2023 meeting of the Eurasian Economic Commission (heads of the authorized energy authorities of the member states) dedicated to resolving “issues on which the parties have long been unable to achieve consensus.” The member-states now appear to have at least temporarily suspended formal meetings on the subject: “The search for solutions on issues sensitive to the parties will continue both on a bilateral basis and at a higher level in order to \u0000nalize and adopt fundamental documents on common markets as soon as possible.”¹¹ Contributing to the intractability of the issue is the fact that the interests of all member-states are involved—not only the gas producer-exporters (Kazakhstan, Russia) but also the gas- importing member-states (Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan). There are essentially two points of contention. The key point, involving all the member-states, is whether a uniform transportation tariﬀ or rate should be set across the entire EAEU economic space or whether the individual EAEU member-states should set their own tariﬀs applicable within their own borders, but would apply equally to all gas being shipped regardless of national origin or individual shipper. The major gas importers are in favor of a uniform tariﬀ (basically on par with average tariﬀs prevailing in the Russian transportation system) across the entire EAEU space, whereas Russia—the main gas supplier within the EAEU—is reluctant, as diﬀerentiated tariﬀs within its borders currently apply to third-party shippers and to Gazprom, and between export and domestic shipments. Substantial cross-subsidization also occurs between long-haul and short-haul shipments within its borders, complicating the deliberations, as the Russians view incorporating such a component into a uniform EAEU tariﬀ as amounting to the subsidization by Russia of the gas transportation costs incurred by shippers of other member-states. A second issue involves third-party access to Russia's gas pipeline network. Although Russia has allowed gas produced in other states to access its gas pipeline network, such access has been highly restricted, usually to gas that has been purchased by Gazprom for onward delivery or through Gazprom-aﬃliated entities. No non-Russian producer/shipper has been allowed to directly deliver gas to Russian consumers. Under the evolving EAEU rules, non-Russian suppliers would have to be given the same access to pipelines and consumers as Russian “independent” gas producers now have. Furthermore, the Russian Law on Gas Export (2006) grants Gazprom monopoly access to the pipeline system on its territory for exports, thus precluding any export possibilities for other Russian gas producers. Under the EAEU rules, such export access is therefore similarly denied to gas producers in other EAEU member-states (i.e., Kazakhstan). Such a situation would also then apply to any Russian gas produc- ers/suppliers"}

Kazakhstan's end-user gas prices are among the lowest among EAEU members, and therefore have “the farthest to go” in terms of price harmonization (see Figure 3.4 Regulated natural gas tariﬀs for residential consumers in EAEU countries). End-user gas prices in Kazakhstan remain heavily administered, and the social goal of supplying low-cost fuel to industrial, commercial, and household customers in the domestic market has been applied for some time. This practice has disincentivized new commercial supply development by Kazakh gas producers (as they already subsidize ar ti\u0000cially low consumer prices through gas sales at producer prices well below market levels or their cost of production); even so, domestic sales are a \u0000nancial loss-making operation for national company QazaqGaz (\u0000nancial losses from deliveries to the domestic market are oﬀset only by export and transit revenues that allows the company overall to remain \u0000nancially solvent). We have observed that under the current schedule for the realization of the Single Market, gas prices in Kazakhstan would need to rise substantially for harmonization to occur. For example, industrial gas prices would need to appreciate by 16% annually during 2021–25 to reach parity with those in Russia's gas- producing regions. ¹² In The National Energy Report 2021, it was our assessment (similar to that made by Kazakhstan's Energy Minister some years ago) that Kazakhstan should harmonize its natural gas prices with those in Russia's gas-producing regions (e.g., Yamal-Nenets Okrug) and not with the higher prices in European Russia's consuming regions, such as neighboring Saratov Oblast (see Figure 3.5 Price outlook for natural gas consumed by industry in western Kazakhstan (Atyrau Oblast): Harmonized with Russia's Yamal-Nenets Okrug ).¹³ Such an approach would: ► allow Kazakhstan's manufacturing industry to remain competitive within the broader EAEU economic space ► enable the government to raise consumer prices less substantially (although still signi\u0000cantly) than if some other benchmarks were used ► help QazaqGaz achieve cost-recovery in the domestic segment of its operations ► potentially incentivize new commercial gas production. 11 https://eec.eaeunion.org/en/news/strany-eaes-sblizhayut-pozitsii-po- voprosam-formirovaniya-obshchikh-rynkov-gaza-nefti-i-nefteprodukt/.EURASIAN ENERGY COOPERATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION 12 Russian domestic gas prices are diﬀerentiated by consumer group and price zones, depending on transportation distances from the main producing region in West Siberia to consumers.

Under the Single Market concept, Kazakhstan essentially cedes control over domestic gas prices, while at the same time accepting more favorable access terms for any Russian gas that it may import or gas that it may transit. The two states appear to be attempting to arrive at a workable compromise on the sidelines of the oﬃcial EAEU multilateral framework that might involve broader cooperation in gas supply and gas infrastructure under the general umbrella of a “Gas Union” proposed in fall 2022 by President Vladimir Putin for Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia (see Chapter 2). Agreement in bilateral talks might achieve the dual objectives of improving the logistics of movements of gas (and electricity) between Russia and Central Asia and increasing Russian deliveries of gas to Kazakhstan's northern and eastern regions. With respect to the former, the existence of transparent and predictable transport tariﬀ rules between Russia and Kazakhstan would not only remove an important obstacle to the 3.2.2.3 Gas trading In addition to transportation and pricing issues, discussions are ongoing concerning the mechanisms that will be allowed for interstate gas trading. When the EAEU was \u0000rst proposed, the idea was that gas trading across borders would be done via exchanges. But de facto a dual approach has emerged, allowing existing bilateral trade relations to continue, augmented with exchange trading. Presently, exchange trading of gas within the EAEU markets is limited to SPIMEX, involving some Belarusian participation alongside Russian buyers and sellers. 3.2.2.4 Summary The potential bene\u0000ts of a Single Market for gas, as it is currently taking shape, for Kazakhstan—essentially a competing gas producer to Russia—are much less clear than for the gas- importing EAEU member-states, especially if access to export markets beyond Russia is essentially precluded.

A commitment to proceed with work on the creation of a Single Market in electric power was reached in April 2019 (slightly later than approval of the oil/products and gas Programs in December 2018), with a draft international agreement (Protocol) establishing the legal basis and principles of the operation of the Single Market, and the areas to be regulated by its rules. The agreement was subsequently approved by the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council. The agreement authorized the Eurasian Intergovernmental Council and the Eurasian Economic Council to adopt acts regulating the Single Market; identi\u0000ed participating entities and organizations as well as bodies and organizations responsible for its operation; and outlined the modes of trading electric power on the Single Market. ¹⁶ Work toward creation of the Single Market is organized under the terms of a document entitled “Protocol on Amendments to the Treaty of the Eurasian Economic Union,” which had been rati\u0000ed by all parliaments of the member-states by 5 April 2022. A major conceptual foundation for the Single Market is that there will be no supranational EAEU electricity market—existing national electricity markets, including capacity markets, will be main- tained—but instead a system of closely integrated national markets will be employed, but operating across national borders in the areas of electricity trade, access to services, interstate power transfers, and information sharing. This con\u0000guration of the Single Market r e\u0000ects historical experience in the operation of an interstate power system that included two of the member- states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan) in the Soviet and immediate post- Soviet periods. However, the greater integration of Central Asian electricity grid will likely continue to be hobbled by the fact that since independence each of the Central Asian states has prioritized the security and independence of their own electric grids over a general system (see box “Soviet-Era Central Asian Integrated Power System Collapses Because of Competing National Power Goals.”). Soviet-Era Integrated Central Asian Power System Collapses Because of Competing National Power Goals During the Soviet period, the Central Asian Uni\u0000ed Energy System (UES) power system (or “pool”) was part of the Soviet Union's national grid, with a central dispatch for this regional system in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. It was operated in parallel with other regional Russian grid systems, such as those within Russia or the ( coal-\u0000red) Northern Kazakhstan network. ¹⁷ The Central Asian system was unique in the sense that electric power systems elsewhere in the USSR coincided with union republic borders or with regions within republics. Meanwhile, the Central Asian Grid united several diﬀerent republics, some rich in hydro-power resources and others possessing abundant thermal power, so that \u0000ows of electricity varied depending on the season and prevalence of generation type in that season. With an integrated power grid and the composi- tion of Central Asia's power capacity in each state being so diverse, after the Soviet break-up the successor countries initially expressed a unilateral intention to continue running the Central Asian dispatch centrally. But true cooperation was never achieved, as the diﬀering uses of water and power inevitably led to disagreements that ultimately led to the eﬀective disintegration of the broader regional grid. The primary disagreement that hindered cooperation was related to the role of hydroelectric power plants (HPPs) located in the upper reaches of rivers in the mountainous terrain of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in regulating the large volumes of water \u0000owing north for the needs of agriculture in the republics that are located along their lower reaches (in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan). Essentially, this meant that in summer months, when agricultural needs for water were greatest for irrigation, HPPs along the Amu Darya and Syr Darya river systems (and their tributaries) would release higher volumes of water and naturally generate more power for the region. Conversely, in winter months, when agriculture needs were less, hydropower facilities were used more to store water in their reservoirs; with less hydropower generation, regional thermal power plants then would take up the power slack. However, the opposite frequently occurred in the USSR, with hydropower increasing in the higher power- demand winter months because of the role HPPs played in balancing power systems (providing reactive power during spikes in power demand). So, in contradiction to the somewhat utopian Soviet ideal, hydropower use in the region often exaggerated summer droughts and winter \u0000ooding in the region, prompting bureaucratic ministerial battles between oﬃcials representing electric power and agricultural interests as well as republic oﬃcials.¹⁸ Following the disintegration of the USSR, leaders in each of the newly independent Central Asian states increasingly began to act according to their own national interests, prioritizing 73 grid reliability and security over multilateral cooperation. By 2019, electricity trade of the Central Asian states fell manyfold compared to 1980s levels, although there has been an uptick in trade since 2020, largely due to a tight electricity balance in Uzbekistan (see Figure 3.6 Central Asian electricity trade). In 2003, Turkmenistan was the \u0000rst to oﬃcially exit the Central Asian UES because the gas-rich state found autarkic operation more stable. By 2008, new 500 kV transmission links built in Tajikistan and Kazakhstan gave these countries greater power independence from the legacy grid, changing the dynamics by which they relied upon their neighbors for power sharing and complicating cross-border power \u0000ows across the entire region.¹⁹ The unruly power-sharing relationship led the central power bond to unravel, with Kazakhstan pulling out of the Central Asian UES in 2008. In protest over Tajikistan's hydropower plans, Uzbekistan followed in 2009. Although some collaboration continues between Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan to support the stability of their"}

Tajikistan would also overdraw, mainly in winter months.EURASIAN ENERGY COOPERATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION Figure 3.6 Central Asian electricity trade (billion kWh) Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global.-40-30-20-10010203040 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2021Kazakhstan exports (-) imports (+) to Central Asia only Tajikistan exports (-) imports (+) Uzbekistan exports (-) imports (+) Kyrgyzstan exports (-) imports (+) Progress toward actual realization of the Single Market—like the oil/products and gas common markets scheduled for 1 January 2025—has been marked both by successes and challenges. In an interview on 7 December 2020, a representative of the Chairman of the Board of the Eurasian Economic Commission indicated four outstanding areas of work that were expected to be completed in mid-2022 or mid-2023 and approved by the Eurasian Intergovernmental Council before the launch of the Single Market in 2025.²⁰ These involved the formulation and approval of documents outlining rules (procedures) governing: ► Mutual trade in electricity (via free bilateral contracts, \u0000xed term contracts, and 24-hour trade contracts), with an expected completion date of 1 July 2022► Access to services for interstate transmission of electricity; expected to be completed by 1 July 2022 ► De\u0000nition and distribution of the throughput capacity of interstate transmission lines; expected to be completed by 1 July 2022 ► Information exchange; expected to be completed by 1 July 2023 Yet less than one year later, in a news report dated 10 February 2022,²¹ the deadline for approval for the documents was pushed back to “2022 and 2023,” and as of this writing, the Intergovernmental Council has approved only the document on access to services for interstate transmission of electricity.²² However, at an 8 June 2023 meeting between representatives of the Eurasian Economic Commission's Subcommission on the Formation of a Common Electricity Market and SPIMEX, clari\u0000cation of draft rules for centralized electricity trading and the exchange of information were discussed. SPIMEX has been designated as one of the three bodies where centralized trading of electricity under \u0000xed-term contracts will be allowed (the other two are the Belarusian Universal Trade Exchange and the Kazakhstan Electricity and Capacity Market Operator).²³ Substantive progress has been reported in such areas as measurement of interstate electricity balances and (load) compensation. More speci\u0000cally, it has been agreed that in the Single Market, electricity will be measured on interstate transmission lines (rather than at points of production or consumption) for the purpose of determining electricity balances 20 https://eng.belta.by/economics/view/most-of-eaeu-common-electricity- market-rules-expected-to-be-ready-by-mid-2022-135642-2020/. 21 https://www.camarabelarus.com/en/blog/446-eaeu-countries-agree-on-the- functioning-of-the-common-electricity-market. 22 Yevraziyskiy Mezhpravitel'stvenniy Sovet, “Resheniye: Ob utverzhdenii Pravil dostupa k uslugam po mezhgosudarstvennoy peredache elektricheskoy energii (moshchnosti) v ramkakh obshchego elektroenergeticheskogo rynka Yevraziyskogo ekonomicheskogo soyuza,” 3 February 2023, Almaty. 23 https://eec.eaeunion.org/en/news/emps-prinyal-reshenie-ob-operatore- tsentralizovannoy-torgovli-elektroenergiey-na-sutki-vpered-na-obshch/. 74 EURASIAN ENERGY COOPERATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION between neighboring states. Agreement also was reached on compensation for deviations between actual and planned interstate electricity balances: “. . . deviations of the actual hourly production and consumption volumes of the subjects of the internal wholesale electricity markets from the planned values, including taking into account transactions on the Common Electricity Market of the EAEU, are subject to compensation by these subjects on the internal wholesale electricity market in accordance with the legislation of the member-state.” ²⁴ Perhaps the most salient diﬀerence in the electricity Single Market (from the oil/products and gas markets) is that at present its impacts on Kazakh domestic electricity prices appear to be limited by the fact that electricity trading will take the form of \u0000xed-term contracts between the designated national power companies of the respective countries, rather than multitudinous transactions between individual producers and consumers of electricity. In other words, the trade in electricity is limited only to speci\u0000c transboundary trade transactions, with ownership of the commodity (electricity) being transferred (to the respective national power company) at the borders between EAEU member-states. Further, the volume of electricity \u0000ows—in the form of imports/exports or interstate \u0000ows for balancing purposes—appears to be quite limited at present. The Russian Federation, for example, exported only 0.3% of the electricity it produced in 2022 (4.5 billion kilowatt-hours [kWh] of a total of 1,138 billion kWh) to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS; a broader coalition of nine Eurasian states that includes all the EAEU members) and imported a truly minuscule quantity (0.5 billion kWh of 1,123.3 billion kWh) from the CIS. ²⁵ At a meeting of Kazakhstan's Mazhilis (lower house of parliament) on 19 January 2022, then-Minister of Energy Bolat Akchulakov stated his belief that the Single Market would not directly lead to a rise in prices, because it prescribes only rules of cooperation.²⁶ Such rules include the right of an organization authorized for interstate electricity transmission to refuse to undertake a speci\u0000c trade. 3.2.4 Tensions between Kazakhstan and Russia over coal transit alleviated by reorientation of the two countries' export destinations Although the EAEU has no speci\u0000c plans for creating a Single Market in another important energy commodity, coal, diﬀerences in interpretation of broad transportation provisions in the EAEU Treaty recently led to tensions between Kazakhstan and Russia over Kazakhstan's rail exports of coal to Asian markets; this occurs via track operated by Russian Railways (JSC RZD) and then shipped to Asian destinations via Russia's Far Eastern ports. As discussed in The National Energy Report 2021, following the launch of the EAEU in January 2015, exports of Kazakhstan's coal (and other goods) in the eastern direction became economically feasible (at least in theory) because of the applicability of Russia's uni\u0000ed internal rail tariﬀs to Kazakhstan's goods transiting to third countries, including via Russian seaports. Although the EAEU Treaty clearly stipulates such equality of access to rail infrastruc- ture and services, shipments on some of the main rail routes to Russia's eastern seaboard have become capacitated, so Kazakh exports were restricted. Kazakh exporters complained about the lack of"}

However, the EU ban on imports of Russian coal on 10 August 2022, which moved westward by rail primarily from mines in the Kuznetsk Basin and then onward via Russia's Baltic and Black Sea ports to Europe, created an opportunity for increased westward shipments of Kazakh coal. Russia reoriented its coal exports toward destinations such as China, India, and Turkey, managing to keep its overall exports from falling by no more than 6.8% on the year. Conversely, Kazakhstan began ramping up exports to Europe in 2022 via Russia, primarily from companies whose coal meets EU emissions standards.²⁸ Consequently, even prior to the ban, in the \u0000rst seven months of 2022, Kazakh coal exports to Europe rose to record levels (6.4 MMt, up 45% year on year), surpassing the full-year 2021 total of 5.2 MMt. Primary European destinations were Switzerland, Poland (which had also instituted a ban of rail transit of Russian coal across its territory), Latvia, and Estonia.²⁹ The expanded European appetite enabled Kazakhstan to export 32.5 MMt of coal (all destinations) in 2022, up 41% from 23 MMt in 2021.³⁰ However, by 14 September 2022, Kazakhstan's government had become suﬃciently concerned about the export momentum detracting from domestic supplies of coal for the fall and winter heating season that it imposed a six-month ban on road (truck) exports of coal (largely to surrounding CIS countries and China, areas immediately adjacent to the country's borders); the ban was later extended another six months by a decree on 27 February 2023.³¹ 24 https://www.camarabelarus.com/en/blog/446-eaeu-countries-agree-on-the- functioning-of-the-common-electricity-market. 25 Tsentral'noye dispetcherskoye upravleniye toplivo-energeticheskogo kompleksa, TEK Rossii, 2023, no. 1, p. 100. 26 https://jjtv.kz/public/index.php/en/eaeu-countries-to-create-common- electricity-market .27 The National Energy Report 2021, pp. 154–155. 28 Shubarkol Komir, Shubarkol Premium, Karazhyra, Maikuben West, and Saryarka Energy are reported as among the top exporters to Europe (https://thecoalhub.com/kazakh-seaborne-coal-exports-surge.html). 29 https://thecoalhub.com/kazakh-coal-exports-to-europe-surge-to-all-time- high-of-6-4-mio-t-in-jan-jul-2022.html; https://astanatimes.com/2022/12/kazakhstan-increases-coal-production-due- to-high-demand-from-europe/. 30 http://www.sxcoal.com/news/4671838/info/en. 31 https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/107127/exportban/kazakhstan- temporary-export-ban-on-coal. 75 32 https://central.asia-news.com/en_GB/articles/cnmi_ca/features/2023/01/12/ feature-02.33 https://www.pipeline-journal.net/news/pakistan-move-forward-tapi-gas- pipeline-project-even-without-india. For background, see IHS Markit, Analysis of the Feasibility of the TAPI Pipeline and Potential Impacts on Regional and Global Gas Markets, October 2019; and the IHS Markit Insight, TAPI pipeline: Still a pipe dream, October 2020. 34 https://tolonews.com/business-182159.3.3 Integration of Central Asian Energy Markets and Systems In discussing the potential for greater energy integration within the Central Asian region, it is important to distinguish between energy markets (mechanisms and rules for the trading of energy) and energy systems (the infrastructure used to produce, transport, store, and consume energy). Additionally, integration initiatives within Central Asia clearly illustrate the importance for each Central Asian country of collaboration with external markets, largely due to its investment needs as well as higher complementarity with outside partners compared to the countries within the region. 3.3.1 Energy markets integration A useful starting point in the discussion of the potential for integration of the energy markets of the individual Central Asian states is the fact—as observed in the preceding section of this chapter—that Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are members of the EAEU and Uzbekistan has observer status. Therefore, to varying degrees, the \u0000rst two countries are actively implementing measures (common rules and standards) to integrate their markets as part of the movement toward the EAEU “Single Markets” for oil/oil products, natural gas, and electricity, planned to be in place already by mid-decade. And Uzbekistan, as an observer, will at least be familiar with those rules and standards. And Russia is now encouraging Turkmenistan to consider EAEU membership as well. Thus, the EAEU may ultimately provide a framework for expanded multilateral cooperation involving various energy markets across several of the Central Asian states. Currently, outside the evolving EAEU single markets framework, bilateral agreements are the prevailing instruments through which Kazakhstan cooperates with its neighbors in the arena of sales and purchases of energy. T o some extent, broader Central Asian cooperation in energy markets has been delayed by historical diﬀerences over other issues. These include con\u0000icts over water rights (between the upstream states of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan and downstream states of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan) and territorial disputes involving Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan—a legacy of Soviet-era boundary delineations. Such diﬀerences are not immutable, as evidenced by recent agreements oﬃcially resolving Uzbekistan's border claims with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.³² Progress in these areas paves the way for joint infrastructure projects such as the proposed China-Kyrgyzstan- Uzbekistan Railway, creating momentum (an improving political environment) that could eventually manifest in a broader regional energy trade framework.3.3.2 Energy systems integration When the subject turns to the integration of energy systems —interlinked infrastructure that facilitates physical \u0000ows of energy—the \u0000rst prerequisite, once energy security concerns have been met, is \u0000nancing for investment in joint projects. This is apparent both in the bilateral agreements concluded by the Central Asian states with external partners as well as in two international “mega-projects” seeking to deliver Central Asian gas and electricity to South Asian markets. 3.3.2.1 TAPI and CASA-1000 T wo multilateral projects designed to integrate the Central and South Asian energy systems—the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan- Pakistan-India (TAPI) natural gas pipeline and Central Asia–South Asia electric power transmission project CASA-1000—are both formally “under construction,” with segments of infrastructure completed in Central Asia. Yet both are, in reality, currently suspended and far from completion. After long periods of sporadic activity on these projects, this is primarily because of lack of \u0000nancing as a result of the challenging security and political situation in the transit country of Afghanistan. Construction of TAPI (33 Bcm/y capacity), which aims to source gas from Galkynysh (Phase 2) and other \u0000elds in Turkmenistan, reportedly began in 2015 (although the original MOU was signed much earlier, in 1995).

A search is underway for an international source of funding for the security force. In the meantime, the commitment of one of the two major gas end-consumers (India) to continue its involvement in the project appears to be wavering. But Pakistan has stated that if India withdraws, it may be willing to purchase India's proposed share of gas.³³ Until recently, CASA-1000 appeared to be the closer of the two projects to completion. The CASA-1000 transmission lines aim to move electricity at high voltage between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan and then from Tajikistan to end-consumers in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It will include 1,387 km of high voltage alternating current (HVAC) and high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines, with a total capacity of 1.3 GW/y during the summer months (1 GW allocated to Pakistan, 300 MW to Afghanistan). Groundbreaking was in 2016, and until 2021 the project appeared to be on pace for completion in 2023. However, following the US departure from Afghanistan in August 2021 and the deteriorating security situation in the country, construction has come to a halt. The reason reported for the delay is the withdrawal of \u0000nancing by the World Bank ($245 million) and the US Agency for International Development. As in the case of TAPI, project participants are reported to be searching for alternative sources of funding.³⁴ Although the project potentially aﬀords possibilities for Kazakhstan—the EURASIAN ENERGY COOPERATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION 76 abundant coal resources of north-central Kazakhstan could be used to generate electricity that could be transmitted southward to CASA-1000 during winter to augment low seasonal hydroelec- tric generation in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan—this would have a negative impact on Kazakhstan's eﬀorts to achieve its greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments and would likely require additional investment in Kazakhstan's high-voltage electricity transmission network. 3.3.2.2 International development bank and other nancing ³⁵ A number of international development banks are involved in \u0000nancing energy infrastructure in Central Asia, including the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and Islamic Development Bank. Nonetheless, their overall level of activity in the region is relatively limited; in 2021, the Central Asian countries received only 4% of the total climate \u0000nance provided by international development banks to low- and middle-income countries. Presently there are 104 ongoing international development bank –\u0000nanced projects in Central Asia, involving mostly water resources and energy systems with a total value of $10.2 billion. The EBRD tops the list of funding providers with a portfolio of $3.3 billion, followed by the World Bank ($3.0 billion) and ADB ($2.6 billion). Within Central Asia, one of the more important multilateral institutions currently helping \u0000nance new energy-sector infrastructure is the Eurasian Development Bank (EDB), established in 2006 and headquartered in Almaty. Although consis ting of the \u0000ve EAEU member states plus Tajikistan, it has no formal aﬃliation with the EAEU. The EDB to date has participated in the co -\u0000nancing of hydro, solar, and wind power projects, investing more than $700 million in green infrastructure and energy eﬃciency projects in the member-countries. Finally, \u0000nancing for clean-energy projects in Kazakhstan and other Central Asian countries is being discussed within the framework of economic forums organized by the European Union and the US Agency for International Development (USAID). The \u0000rst USAID–Central Asia Clean Energy Forum convened in Almaty on 13–15 September 2022 to explore emerging clean-energy investment opportunities in the region. It was organized under the auspices of a \u0000ve-year, $40 billion USAID “Power Central Asia” program (2020) to develop the region's energy sector, invest in clean energy, and promote trans- boundary trade. One of the outcomes of the forum was the establishment of a virtual platform for the sharing of information on technological innovation in the renewable energy sector.³⁶ Not long thereafter, the second European Union–Central Asian economic forum was held in Almaty, Kazakhstan on 18 and 19 May 2023. Although the EU forum does not provide \u0000nancing directly, it does oﬀer a pathway to investment \u0000nancing for clean- energy projects by aﬃliated banks such as the EBRD and European Investment Bank.³⁷3.3.2.3 Bilateral projects The limited \u0000nancial resources of the individual Central Asian countries constrain the number and scale of bilateral energy system projects between them. Rather than agreements between individual Central Asian countries on the development of energy infrastructure, the bulk of bilateral energy projects in the region instead has involved cooperation with larger, wealthier neighbors such as China, Russia, and UAE. In recent years, China has been the most active investor in the region, with that country's \u0000nancing and joint projects for infrastructure development \u0000tting squarely within the “One Belt, One Road” framework of its foreign economic policy. In May 2023 alone, a \u0000urry of bilateral energy-sector agreements was concluded on the sidelines of the inaugural China–Central Asia Summit. China–Central Asia Summit. In what many observers viewed as a counterpoint to the Group of 7 (G7) annual meeting of major democratic industrialized nations held in Hiroshima, Japan on 19–21 May 2023, the People's Republic of China hosted an inaugural “China–Central Asia Summit” in Xian, on 18–19 May 2023. The Summit, the \u0000rst in what are planned to be regular biennial meetings,³⁸ appears to represent an eﬀort by China to more closely coordinate its development strategies with those of the Central Asian states as well as to burnish its international credentials as a reliable diplomatic and trade partner. The areas of planned coordination are diverse, ranging from law enforcement, security, and defense cooperation to the upgrading of bilateral investment agreements (including in energy) and increasing cross- border trade and international transit traﬃc. On 19 May—the concluding day of the Summit devoted to a grand assemblage of the national delegations (each headed by the respective countries' presidents) and a press confer- ence—China's President Xi Jinping pledged"}

The opening day of the Summit (18 May) was devoted to a series of bilateral investment talks between China and each of the \u0000ve Central Asian states. The most active bilateral discussions centered on Kazakhstan, China's most important trading partner in the region. The volume of bilateral trade between the two countries hit a record high of $31 billion in 2022 (44% of total China–Central Asia trade of $70 billion in that year). As a result of their bilateral discussions on 18 May, Kazakhstan and China signed 47 economic agreements worth a total of $22 billion.⁴¹ A key 38 Kazakhstan is scheduled to host the next Summit in 2025. 39 China's estimated cumulative investment in the region prior to the announcement was approximately $15 billion ( Vedomosti , 19 May 2023). 40 Andrew Hayley, “China's Xi Unveils Grand Development Plan for Central Asia,” Reuters, 19 May 2023; https://www.reuters.com/world/a sia-paci\u0000c/chinas-xi- calls-stable-secure-central-asia-2023-05-19/; http://mv.china- embassy.gov.cn/eng/zgyw/202305/t20230519_11080116.htm. 41 https://astanatimes.com/2023/05/kazakhstan-and-china-sign-47-agreements- worth-22-billion-as-tokayev-outlines-key-areas-for-partnership/.EURASIAN ENERGY COOPERATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION ³⁸ 35 E.

More speci\u0000cally, the following agreements were signed in the sector: ► Expansion of the capacity of certain sections (Atyrau- Kenkiyak [from 6 to 12 MMt/y] and Kenkiyak-Kumkol [from 10 to 15 MMt/y]) of the Kazakhstan-China oil pipeline to boost oil exports (between KazMunayGas [KMG] and China National Petroleum Corporation [CNPC]; $200 million) .⁴² ► Expansion of Kazakhstan's gas processing capacity, including a feasibility study on the construction of a gas processing plant at the Kashagan \u0000eld with a capacity of 4 Bcm/y⁴³ (between the Samruk-Kazyna national wealth fund and CNPC). ► Construction of a second string (15 Bcm/y) of the Beyneu- Bozoy-Shymkent (BBS) gas pipeline, linking western Kazakhstan's gas \u0000elds with the Central Asia–China Gas Pipeline [CAGP]; (between JSC QazaqGaz and CNPC). ► Growth of cooperation in the \u0000eld of natural gas exploration (including at promising new tracts) and \u0000eld development (QazaqGaz and CNPC). ⁴⁴ As part of the cooperation agreement, QazaqGaz and CNPC have pledged to: (a) sign a (new) natural gas purchase and sales agreement based on the resource base and throughput capacity of QazaqGaz's gas pipelines and (b) to share scienti\u0000c, technical, and research expertise to develop technological innovations in the gas industry. ► Cooperation in upstream oil and gas exploration (KMG and Sinopec International Energy Investment Limited) at 17 locations in Kazakhstan. Should deposits at any of these locations prove to be prospective, the parties will consider a possibility of licensing for \u0000eld development and production.⁴⁵ ► Entry of China's Sinopec into the second phase of develop- ment of the Atyrau integrated gas-chemical complex (1.25 MMt/y polyethylene plant). The parties (KMG and China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation [Sinopec]) agreed to the joint implementation of a project to produce polyethylene in the Atyrau region (Karabatan), with Sinopec joining the project as a f ull-\u0000edged partner on par with SIBUR (the Russian petrochemical group currently holding a 40% ownership stake). The project participants are expected to make a \u0000nal investment decision in 2024. ► Construction of a 1 GW wind farm in the Zhambyl Oblast (Kazakhstan National Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna, the Kazakh Ministry of Energy, China Power International Holding Ltd. (CPIH), and China's SANY Renewable Energy). The project reportedly will increase Kazakhstan's total power generation from renewable energy sources by 40%. In addition, CPIH will participate in the construction of factories in Kazakhstan to produce towers, nacelles, and blades for wind turbines.In addition to talks on hydrocarbons, a number of discussions were held on possible Chinese investments in developing “clean energy” minerals. More speci \u0000cally, a joint agreement was announced between KAZ Minerals and the China Nonferrous Metal Industry's Foreign Engineering and Construction Company (NFC) to construct a new copper smelter that would give Kazakhstan the capacity to process the entire volume of copper concentrate produced in the country, increasing the value-added component from the production of this metal and providing an ample supply of this “elec tri\u0000cation metal” for future decarbon- ization eﬀorts. Also, discussions focused on development of Kazakhstan's extensive reserves of lithium and rare-earth metals. Finally, President T okayev met with the President of China's Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Jin Liqun, to discuss plans for the further development of activities in the country.⁴⁶ In recent years, Kazakhstan has developed green energy projects with the support of the Bank.

The discussions centered on joint projects in the \u0000eld of energy (natural gas), transport and communications, and the chemical, petrochemical, and electric power industries. Delegates discussed the supply of energy resources to interna- tional markets, cooperation in the transport and communications sector, and partnership in the railway transport sector. Upon conclusion of the meeting, the parties announced the signing of agreements on customs and border issues, media and communi- cations, and general cooperation between the Democratic Party of Turkmenistan and the Chinese Communist Party. Uzbekistan. ⁵² On 18 May, President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev met with President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping. In the economic arena, the parties reviewed their cooperation in joint projects in the \u0000elds of agriculture, land use, small and medium-sized business activity, infrastructure modernization, medical services, and vocational education; prospects for construction of a China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan Railway also were discussed. In the energy sector, the focus of talks was investment and technological cooperation in the development of renewable energy in Uzbekistan. A speci\u0000c emphasis was on the construction of solar, wind, and hydroelectric power plants and supporting infrastructure for electri\u0000cation: ► the production of solar electric power equipment (trans- formers and batteries), including the creation of a high-tech cluster for the production of electrical products based on the processing of copper, lithium, and rare-earth metals ► the potential for deepening cooperation in the production of new-generation cars, in particular, the launch of modern plants for the production of electric and hybrid vehicles. Uzbek oﬃcials later disclosed that the two countries had agreed at the Summit “to create more than 6 GW of new renewable energy sources and new transmission lines and substations worth more than $6 billion.”⁵³ The State Grid Corporation of China, Xian Electric, and TBEA were reported as potential partners in the project. Concluding remarks. The Summit marks only the latest tranche of investments in a long-standing pattern of Chinese energy investment in Central Asia. The China Development Bank, for instance, has been involved in \u0000nancial support in such major projects as the three existing gas pipeline strings of the CAGP, the \u0000rst and second phases of the development of the Galkynysh gas \u0000eld in Turkmenistan, and a polypropylene plant operated by the Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries Inc. (KPI) with an annual capacity of 500,000 tons. CNPC has been the operating partner in developing the Bagtiyarlyk gas \u0000elds in eastern Turkmenistan and is now a partner in the NCOC consortium operating Kazakhstan's Kashagan oﬀshore mega-project. According to China's Ministry of Commerce, as of the end of March 2023, China's total direct investments (all sectors) in the \u0000ve Central Asian countries exceeded US $15 billion.⁵⁴ Russia-Central Asia. The Russian Federation has substantial and long-standing economic ties to the Central Asian countries, not least in the form of now legacy (but in many cases still extant) Soviet-era technical standards and energy transportation infrastructure. The focus of much recent Russian investment in the region, particularly since 2022, is on the utilization (or upgrading) of this transportation infrastructure to facilitate deliveries of Russian gas, electricity, and crude oil to consumers in the region and perhaps using their territory to transit energy to more distant markets in China and South Asia. A good example of this recent focus on Central Asian states as both export markets and transit countries are the trilateral discussions between Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan to coordinate gas deliveries, including activities to refurbish natural gas infrastructure (e.g., pipelines, compressor stations) to support more intra-regional and international gas trade (see Chapter 2). Among other things, the talks are designed to (a) facilitate Russian gas exports to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan via existing natural gas infrastructure (e.g., Soviet-era Central Asia–Center pipeline) and new pipelines in eastern Kazakhstan; (b) make it possible for Russian gas to enter the CAGP for export to China or eventually move southward to Turkmenistan to supply South Asia; (c) free up some domestic gas for Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to export to China.

Similarly, deliveries of electricity by Russia's Inter RAO to Kyrgyzstan via Kazakhstan began in April 2023. Up to 900 million kWh of power is planned to be exported over the period of the agreement (15 April 2023 through 31 March 2024) between Inter RAO and JSC Electric Stations of Kyrgyzstan. However, Inter RAO representatives observed that even more power could delivered if the transit capacity of Kazakhstan's electricity grid is expanded, potentially rising to a level that would meet Kyrgyzstan's current “unmet” power demand (estimated as 3 billion kWh annually). The parties plan to review delivery schedules “on a regular basis in accordance with the provisions of dispatch control and the rules of the energy markets.”⁵⁵ In the case of crude oil, Uzbekistan announced an agreement with Russia's Gazprom Neft to purchase 300,000 tons of oil in 2023, transiting through Kazakhstan. More speci\u0000cally, Kazakhstan's oil pipeline operator KazTransOil announced plans to ship at least 250,000 tons of transit crude from Russia to Uzbekistan, using the Omsk-Pavlodar-Shymkent pipeline, with loading by rail for the \u0000nal leg of the journey to Uzbekistan.⁵⁶ 50 Interfax Central Asia & Caucasus Business Weekly , 23 May 2023. 51 https://www.hronikatm.com/2023/05/ca-cn-summit/?ysclid=lhupqt33rp116413075. 52 https://nuz.uz/politika/1277016-prezident-obsudil-v-siane-organizacziyu- proizvodstva-v-uzbekistane-elektromobilej-i-drugie-sovmestnye-s-kitaem- proekty.html. 53 Nefte Compass, Vol. 32, No. 20, 24 May 2023. 54 https://www.newscentralasia.net/2023/05/23/over-1-4-bln-has-been- allocated-by-china-to-support-projects-in-central-asia/. 55 https://tass.com/economy/1605589; see also Central Asia & Caucasus Business Weekly, 18 April 2023. 56 Interfax Central Asia & Caucasus Business Weekly, 7 March 2023; https://www.gazeta.uz/en/2023/04/27/oil/.EURASIAN ENERGY COOPERATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION 79 Russia's Lukoil also has been an active partner in joint ventures producing oil and gas in Uzbekistan and oil in Kazakhstan (as well as being a member of the multinational consortia KPO and TCO operating in the latter country). However, the situations at two of the more recently emerging projects—at Dostluk and Zhenis—are emblematic of the new more challenging operating environment for Russian companies in the region in 2023. Dostluk is an oﬀshore oil and gas \u0000eld in the Caspian in an area claimed by both Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan. Once contested between the two governments, in a major breakthrough on 21 January 2021, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the two governments on joint exploration and development of the \u0000eld's hydrocarbon resources. Lukoil was considered to have the inside track on being named the \u0000eld operator, but the situation became more complicated in 2022. Although Lukoil was not directly the target of Western sanctions against Russia, reports have surfaced that Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are considering other potential candidates for \u0000eld operator, such as the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, out of concerns that Lukoil's participation in the current environment could complicate eﬀorts to obtain international \u0000nancing, conduct marketing, and access international oil services. ⁵⁷ Similarly, before it was abandoned in July 2023 due to drilling a dry well, Lukoil's exploration joint venture with Kazakhstan's KMG at the Zhenis oﬀshore oil \u0000eld reportedly experienced delays in obtaining parts for a drilling rig. ⁵⁸ In the nuclear power space, Russia's Rosatom is interested in participating in the build-out of nuclear power generation in the region. In 2018 Rosatom concluded an agreement in principle with Uzbekistan to construct two VVER-1200 pressurized water reactors in the country (1200 MW capacity each), with project costs estimated in the range of $10–13 billion; anticipated completion would be in 2028. The parties then focused on site selection and design considerations, and in July 2022 the two parties concluded an MOU. However, no FID has yet been announced. Negotiations over costs may be one impediment, but there also may be diﬃculties stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and possible international sanctions on Rosatom. And even if Rosatom remains unsanctioned, there may be collateral eﬀects (e.g., self-sanctioning by third-party service providers) that may be leading the Uzbek side to await greater clarity on the outcome of the con\u0000ict before making a \u0000nal decision to proceed.⁵⁹ Kazakhstan—a major world producer of uranium concen- trate—has announced plans to construct high-capacity (up to 2.8 GW) nuclear power plants on its territory (provisionally within 10 years) and is holding talks both with the International Atomic Energy Agency on provision of support for Kazakhstan's nuclear energy program development as well as representatives from reactor companies of at least four countries (China, France, Russia, and South Korea) interested in bidding on contracts to build the reactors. In addition, small modular reactor technologies are currently being considered as a promising direction for subsequent development of nuclear energy in Kazakhstan. ⁶⁰ Azerbaijan-Central Asia. Azerbaijan has a shared history with the Central Asian countries as a former Soviet republic, and shares a common pan-Turkic identity with four of the \u0000ve Central Asian nations (sans Tajikistan). However, its relations with Turkmenistan have until recently been aggravated by competing territorial claims in the Caspian Sea. Nonetheless, the agreement to jointly develop the Dostluk \u0000eld (see above) in January 2021 has gone a long way to alleviate tensions and pave the way to greater cooperation. At present, Azerbaijan participates in Central Asian energy development primarily as an alternative transit country (to Russia) for relatively small exports of Kazakh crude via the BTC pipeline and as an outlet for small volumes of Turkmen gas (via a swap arrangement with Iran (see Chapter 2)). However, its national oil company SOCAR has been in talks with Uzbekneftegaz about upstream development and upgrading the Bukhara r e\u0000nery, and at high-level talks between the Azeri and Tajik presidents, the possibility of Azerbaijan's participation in the development of Tajik gas \u0000elds was discussed.⁶ ¹ United Arab Emirates-Central Asia. Among other active countries involved in Central Asian energy development, the Mideast Gulf countries, particularly the United Arab Emirates (UAE) stand out. Three UAE companies have been particularly active in the Caspian and Central Asian region in 2023, focusing on maritime oil transportation, renewable power plant construc- tion, and upstream gas exploration and production: ► Abu Dhabi Ports, which entered into agreements in early 2023 with (a) KazTransOil to jointly operate"}

In January 2023, Kazakhstan's national company QazaqGaz also signed memoranda of cooperation with UAE companies (Dragon Oil; Petromal LLP) to implement exploration projects and develop new gas \u0000elds, as well as to construct additional gas processing capacity.⁶ ⁴ 61 Interfax Central Asia & Caucasus Business Weekly, 11 April 2023 and 23 May 2023. 62 Interfax Central Asia & Caucasus Business Weekly, 4 April 2023 and 11 April 2023. 63 Energy Intelligence, Nefte Compass, 1 February 2023. 64 Interfax Central Asia & Caucasus Business Weekly, 24 January 2023.57 Energy Intelligence, Nefte Compass , 3 May 2022. 58 Energy Intelligence, Nefte Compass , 1 March 2023. 59 https://thediplomat.com/2022/12/russia-wants-to-speed-up-joint-nuclear- power-plant-project-in-uzbekistan/. 60 Kazakhstan Newsline, 30 December 2022.EURASIAN ENERGY COOPERATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION 80 3.4 High-Level Takeaways ► In its eﬀorts toward regional energy cooperation and economic integration, Kazakhstan's policymakers must come to terms with the fact that energy prices throughout the value chain, including producer prices and end-user prices, need to increase in order to ensure reliable supplies of crude oil for domestic re\u0000neries as well as r e\u0000ned products, commercial gas, and electric power for Kazakh consumers. Ar ti\u0000cially low prices disincentivize producers to supply the domestic market and lead to the unauthorized/undocumented out \u0000ow of Kazakh energy products (especially in border regions) to neighboring states. Price parity between Kazakhstan and its neighbors will need to be achieved primarily by economic measures, such as open market trading via exchanges or liberalizing exports and imports. ► Accession to the EAEU provides a mechanism whereby Kazakh energy prices can rise to parity with those in fellow EAEU member states (particularly Russia) as part of a general move- ment toward integrated open markets. Higher energy prices will provide clear bene\u0000ts by increasing the eﬃciency of energy consumption (in the process lowering GHG emissions) and reducing unauthorized (“grey”) exports to consumers in bordering countries. The government should take steps to reduce the burden of higher prices for particularly vulnerable segments of the population but in general should not seek to disrupt the general upward trajectory. ► Kazakhstan must continue to look for ways to increase its attractiveness as a destination for foreign energy-sector investment and cooperation in an increasingly competitive international environment for scarce global capital resources. Although some conditions such as subsoil geology and geography are relatively \u0000xed, improvements in \u0000scal and licensing policies nonetheless have the potential to substantially increase the country's attractiveness for energy development, both for such traditional fuels as oil and gas and for new clean-energy projects focused on renewable energy. ► Broad Central Asian cooperation in energy markets and infrastructure to date has been delayed by historical diﬀerences over other issues such as water rights and territorial disputes, as well as limited access to project \u0000nancing. The historical diﬀerences are not immutable, and the start of cooperation will create a supportive environment and momentum for broader regional energy cooperation in the future. Similarly, access to \u0000nancing for joint energy projects should improve over time as the region becomes better known to outside investors. It also may be advisable for countries in the region to consider pooling their own capital resources through the establishment of a Central Asian development bank—or via enhanced cooperation through existing institutions such as the Asian Development Bank's Central Asian Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program or the Eurasian Development Bank—to support joint projects in energy production and transportation, water management, and related activities. EURASIAN ENERGY COOPERATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION 81 KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 4. KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 4.1 Key Points ► Since independence, Kazakhstan has made signi \u0000cant progress in aligning its environmental laws with global practices and standards. Kazakhstan's current environmental legislation is intended to provide a pathway to sustainable development, environmental protection, preservation of natural resources, and environmental safety, especially with further r e\u0000nement. ► Among the Central Asian nations, Kazakhstan has been at the forefront of international eﬀorts to address climate change since the 1990s and has made commitments to the international community to reduce its own carbon emissions. As part of its overall strategy, Kazakhstan has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. In the medium term, the country's goals under the Paris Agreement include reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 15% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, or 25% contingent upon the availability of international support and \u0000nancing. ► Kazakhstan is actively working to reduce barriers to foreign investment in renewable energy sources (RES) and other clean- energy technologies. The government is taking steps to improve legislation to create a stable and predictable regulatory environ- ment and to oﬀer a variety of bene\u0000ts and \u0000nancial incentives to stimulate investment. Nevertheless, legal uncertainties and \u0000nancial risks still pose challenges. T o improve the investment attractiveness of RES and related technologies, it is important to continue eﬀorts to clarify legislation and establish mechanisms to provide stability and reduce risks for investors. The decarboniza- tion eﬀorts of other countries may suggest new approaches for Kazakhstan on how to address these challenges. ► Mainland China and the"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_NationalReport23_en_59", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\NationalReport23_en.pdf", "text": "EU have comprehensive decarboniza- tion plans encompassing a number of speci\u0000c programs: the “1 + N” decarbonization framework in the PRC and the “Fit for 55” plan in the EU. The Chinese program relies largely on strong central guidance (state-led capitalism) as the vehicle for moving the economy toward lower carbon emissions, whereas the EU plan is focused heavily on regulation. ► The US approach, in contrast, is less comprehensive and more market-inspired —there is no single decarbonization plan. It is based largely on incentives for adoption of clean energy technologies (tax credits and subsidies) provided in the recently enacted In\u0000ation Reduction Act. Regulation is also important, but it mostly occurs within pre-existing frameworks (e.g., the US Environmental Protection Agency's proposed regulations for GHG emissions in electricity generation, emissions standards for new automobiles, and methane emissions regulations). ► The Russian approach seems to be an opportunistic combination of strategies that leverage existing comparative advantages: abundant natural gas resources that can be exported (or used in the production of grey hydrogen for export) to countries wishing to use less-dirty fuels in power generation (e.g., coal in China); forest management (land use, land-use change, and forestry [LULUCF]) as a carbon emissions oﬀset; and some domestic industry emissions reductions associated with energy eﬃciency improvements. The latter (eﬃciency) strategy has now been complicated by restrictions on imports of advanced Western energy technologies (such as gas turbines in power generation) following the invasion of Ukraine. ► Similar to mainland China, the European Union, and the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan has a speci\u0000c document that serves as a decarbonization roadmap toward attaining its net-zero GHG emissions goal—the Low-Carbon Development Strategy (to 2060), adopted in February 2023. The Low-Carbon Development Strategy outlines speci \u0000c targets for gross emissions, absorption (LULUCF), and net emissions for the country for key signposts in 2030, 2040, 2050, and 2060. That said, the Strategy is largely a set of concepts (on how to get to net zero) rather than an action plan as such; it does not really elaborate on how existing programs and agencies \u0000t within the grand plan and will coordinate their activities under its frame- work. Nonetheless, because Kazakhstan has now established a set of programs and institutions for decarbonization, including both regulatory and incentives-based approaches, there is fairly broad scope for signi\u0000cant progress in emissions reductions. ► For example, Kazakhstan's carbon emission trading system (ETS), introduced as a pilot program in 2013, certainly has the potential to greatly reduce the country's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Such a system quanti\u0000es emissions targets and permits emission allowances to be traded among participants, encourag- ing emitters to adopt cleaner technologies and practices at lowest cost, ultimately leading to a decrease in overall emissions. However, despite already being in its “ \u0000fth phase” of development, Kazakhstan's ETS still requires further r e\u0000nement as its current operation, including carbon price formation, does not really incentivize entities to pursue greener solutions. ► An important participant in the ETS is the electric power sector. Reducing coal use in electric power generation is key for Kazakhstan, as the electric power sector accounts for nearly half of total GHG emissions (about 46%), and over 70% of generation is from coal-\u0000red power plants. Without meaningful progress here, all the other decarbonization strategies in the Low-Carbon Development Strategy probably will be insuﬃcient to bring down emissions substantially. But there is a limit to how far Kazakhstan can realistically shift away from coal in power generation over the near term, particularly in light of energy security considerations. ► Similarly, in industry, the 2021 Environmental Code introduced a number of important initiatives aimed at reducing and mitigating the environmental impact of economic activities, particularly the operations of large industrial enterprises. Currently, eﬀorts are underway to prepare domestic operators for a shift to Best Available Techniques (BAT) principles. According to the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, an integrated technological audit was conducted at 94 enterprises in key industries as part of the transition towards the BAT principles 83 by the end of the August 2023. For the 50 largest emitters during 2021-23, 16 industry-speci \u0000c BAT reference books were developed. There are plans to develop 14 more BAT reference books during 2024-27. ► Despite the active promotion of a low-carbon policy in Kazakhstan, the number of actual projects for the production of clean-energy products remains limited. The largest proposal to date is the project for the production of green hydrogen in Mangystau Oblast, which may nonetheless face the problem of limited water resources in the region and high transportation cost within the overall value chain. Among companies in the energy sector, KMG perhaps is taking the most active steps. The company is trying to explore opportunities to reduce its carbon footprint through projects such as hydrogen development and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). Another area with signs of activity is in electric vehicles. With increasing demand for electric cars, the market for large- and small-scale assembly of electric vehicles in Kazakhstan is actively developing with the involvement of large Chinese players. ► Government support for reducing carbon emissions is crucial for achieving climate targets and transitioning to sustainable development. T o attain the long-term objective of decarbonizing the economy and meeting climate targets, the state must implement tangible support measures that complement the adoption of legislative acts. While legislation is crucial, the eﬀective execution of speci\u0000c actions is essential for the energy sector's successful transformation and overall reduction of GHG emissions. 4.2 Overview of Kazakhstan's Environmental Legislation and Policies 4.2.1 Overview of relevant laws and regulations, including the Environmental Code Kazakhstan's environmental legislation is intended to be a signi\u0000cant contributor to sustainable development, environmen- tal protection, preservation of natural resources, and environ- mental safety. Kazakhstan's environmental legislation has its roots in the Soviet era. However, after gaining independence in 1991, the country began to develop its own environmental laws to address its unique circumstances and interests. Consequently, the Republic of Kazakhstan enacted the law “On Environmental Protection” in 1997, which served"}

Kazakhstan has made signi \u0000cant progress in aligning its environmental laws with global practices and standards. These laws aim to safeguard the quality of air, water, and soil by controlling pollutants, managing waste, and promoting recycling. They also protect natural habitats, including national parks and reserves, regulate the use of natural resources, preserve biodiversity, endangered animals and plant species, mitigate climate change, and promote eco-friendly behavior among individuals and communities. These eﬀorts demonstrate Kazakhstan's commitment to preserving its environment for future generations. The government's executive power plays a crucial role in developing and implementing environmental laws. Regular updates and improvements to these laws are necessary to address new environmental challenges and enhance environmental protection. In 2007, the \u0000rst Environmental Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan (also known as the Ecology Code) was introduced to strengthen legal regulation in environmental protection and nature management. The Code is the primary legislative act that comprehensively addresses environmental concerns. However, certain provisions proved to be ineﬀective. To modernize infrastructure, increase energy eﬃciency, and improve the overall environmental situation in the country, a new Environmental Code was adopted on 2 January 2021. This is another positive step towards protecting the environment and ensuring a sustainable future. ² Along with the Environmental Code, Kazakhstan's environmental policy encompasses myriad supporting documents and regulations: ► In February 2023, Kazakhstan adopted its Low-Carbon Development Strategy, pledging to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2060. The strategy takes into account global climate trends and international obligations , and outlines a set of concepts and goals for state environmental policy. The goal is to gradually transform the economy to ensure sustainable economic growth, social progress, and well-being. The strategy prioritizes the adaptation of Kazakhstan's economy to global climate trends, focusing on measures such as promoting ESG principles, attracting \"green\" investments, developing energy-eﬃcient production, promoting electri\u0000cation, and other environmentally friendly solutions. These actions will pave the way for a \"greener\" and more sustainable future for Kazakhstan. ³ ► In 2013, Kazakhstan put forward two important documents —the Development Strategy until 2050 and the Concept for the Transition to a “Green Economy.” These documents lay down the groundwork for implementing signi\u0000cant changes that will help the country transition to a “greener” economy, while minimizing the negative impact on the environment. The goal is to reduce the energy intensity of GDP by 50% by 2050, compared to 2008 levels, and increase the use of alternative sources of electricity to 50% by 2050. These documents provide a roadmap for reducing GHG emissions in the energy sector, while promoting energy eﬃciency and conservation. There is also a focus on sustainable transportation, creating infrastructure for electric and gas- 1 Kazakhstan's Law \"On Environmental Protection,\" dated 15 July 1997, is no longer valid, as it has been replaced by Kazakhstan's Environmental Code, dated 9 January 2007. 2 See Section 2.6 in The National Energy Report 2021 ; and S&P Global Commodity Insights, Lots of Sticks and Few Carrots: BAT implementation in the energy sector within Kazakhstan's new Ecology Code, November 2021. 3 The Strategy involves investing $610 billion in low-carbon technologies, which will include $10 billion by 2030, with the remaining $600 billion to be invested by the end of 2060. KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 84 \u0000red vehicles, managing municipal waste sustainably, adopting sustainable land use methods, and developing organic agriculture. ► Kazakhstan undertook an Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) as part of its compliance with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. The goal of the INDC is to achieve an unconditional target of reducing GHG emissions by 15% economy-wide by 2030, compared to 1990 (or a conditional target of 25% below the 1990 level by 2030). ⁴ In 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources updated the INDC by adding a new chapter on adaptation to climate change. ► On 15 July 2022, the Government of Kazakhstan approved the Investment Policy Concept until 2026. This policy aims to adhere to fundamental principles such as transitioning to “green” growth, promoting the development of sustainable and “green” \u0000nancing instruments, and implementing ESG principles. ► Chapter 20 of the Environmental Code outlines regulations for controlling GHG emissions, including a market-based approach for the Emission Trading System (ETS) . This system covers approximately half of the country's carbon emissions and is a crucial platform for meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement and Kazakhstan's environmental goals by 2060. ⁵ ► The Code “On Subsoil and Subsoil Use” was put into eﬀect on 27 December 2017. This Code sets forth guidelines for the use of the subsoil, outlines the state's management and regulation procedures in this \u0000eld, and establishes the legal status of subsoil users and their operations. Additionally, the Code addresses concerns surrounding the transfer of subsoil use rights. Environmental safety is a critical factor in the rational management of the subsoil according to the Code. ► The Land Code, which was enacted on 20 June 2003, is grounded on the values of safeguarding and rationalizing the use of land resources, along with ensuring environmental security. Its main objective is to avoid any damage to the land as a natural asset caused by entities involved in land use. ► The Forest Code, enacted on 8 July 2003, sets guidelines for public interactions regarding the ownership, utilization, and disposal of forest resources. This legislation also provides a legal framework for protection, conservation, restoration, and eﬃcient use of forest resources. It is worth noting that forest legal relations are regulated with particular emphasis on the forest's role as a vital component of the biosphere, which has signi \u0000cant ecological, social, and economic implications on a global scale. ► The Water Code , enacted on 9 July 2003, aims to ensure the responsible and sustainable use of water resources. Its goal is"}

Currently, a draft of a new Water Code is being developed in Kazakhstan with the aim of introducing system standards that encourage eﬃcient water consumption by individuals, farmers, and enterprises, and incentivize closed-cycle water use and treatment by enterprises and households. ► The Law “On Support for the Use of Renewable Energy Sources” was enacted on 4 July 2009. This law outlines the objectives, strategies, and approaches for promoting the utilization of renewable energy sources. Furthermore, it establishes guidelines and systems for managing energy waste and utilizing secondary energy resources. ► The Law on “Energy Saving and Increase of Energy Eﬃciency,” dated 13 January 2012, outlines the legal, economic, and organizational principles that govern the actions of individuals and organizations with regards to energy conservation and eﬃciency. ► The Law “On Specially Protected Natural Areas,” passed on 7 July 2006, governs all matters related to the formation, expansion, protection, sustainable use, and administration of specially protected natural territories and objects within the State Nature Reserve Fund. These areas and objects hold signi\u0000cant ecological, scienti\u0000c, historical, and cultural value, and are a vital component of the national, regional, and global ecological network. ► The Law on “On Protection, Reproduction and Use of the Animal World,” from 9 July 2004, manages issues concerning the protection, reproduction, and use of wildlife. Its objective is to facilitate the preservation of wildlife and biotic diversity, while also ensuring the sustainable utilization of wildlife resources to f ul\u0000ll human needs, both environmental and economic. ► The Law on “Compulsory Environmental Insurance,” which was enacted on 13 December 2005, governs the public relations that arise in the realm of mandatory environmental insurance. It also sets forth the legal, economic, and organizational principles for its implementation. Kazakhstan thus has in place a broad complement of programs and institutions to help drive decarbonization. The challenge arises in ensuring the eﬀective coordination of these various programs and the creation of viable regulations and nancial incentives. 4.2.2 Overview of restrictions and barriers to foreign investment in green energy technologies Kazakhstan has made a strong commitment to renewable energy, following global best practices. This is evident in the country's legislative framework. For example, the Concept for the Transition to a “Green Economy” sets a goal of increasing the proportion of renewable energy in electricity production from 4.5% in 2022 to 15% by 2030, and ultimately 50% by 2050. The Strategic Development Plan until 2025 targets a 6% share of renewable energy in the country's energy balance by 2025. The Government of Kazakhstan has implemented several important measures to support investors in renewable energy development. These measures include: ► guaranteed purchase of renewable energy at the prices bid at auctions for 20 years through a power purchase agreement 4 The conditional target is contingent upon Kazakhstan receiving additional international investments and \"green\" climate funds, technology transfer of low- carbon technologies, and additional \u0000exibility owing to its status as an \"economy in transition.\" 5 See Section 4.4 . KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 85 ► an increase in the renewable energy tariﬀ's indexation rate from 70% to 100% in relation to the exchange rate of the tenge to the US dollar ► an exemption for renewable energy producers for paying for electricity transmission ► an exemption for renewable energy producers from the \u0000nancial responsibility to settle any grid imbalances from their activities, settled instead by the Financial Settlement Center (although this no longer applies to new projects) ⁶ ► priority dispatch for renewable energy in electricity transmission ► land plots and access points to the network are assured through the broader auction process for renewable energy projects. Furthermore, renewable energy projects have been included in the list of priority investment projects. This grants them certain bene\u0000ts such as exemption from customs duties and VAT on imports, and exemption from property tax, land tax, and corporate income tax. The Law “On Support for the Use of Renewable Energy Sources” underwent amendments and additions in 2017 to introduce an auction mechanism for selecting renewable energy projects. This allows investors to compete on the basis of bid prices for renewable energy projects oﬀered. The auction process ensures transparency, with the winner and project prices determined during the auction. However, due to COVID-2019 and issues such as grid integration, lack of \u0000exible capacity, and outdated traditional generating capacity, the amount of new renewable capacity oﬀered in auctions has decreased. This has likely contributed to the recent decrease in renewable energy investment in Kazakhstan, even as the rest of the world has seen an increase in such investments (see Figure 4.1 Investments in environmental activities related to the \"green economy\" in Kazakhstan, 2013-21, and Figure 4.2 Global renewable energy investment trends, 2013-22). In 2022, the Ministry of Energy auctioned seven wind projects (wind power plants or WPP), including one with a capacity of 100 MW and six with capacities of 50 MW each; three solar power (SPP) projects, each with a capacity of 20 MW; one 10 MW BioES (biofuels) project; and two hydro (HPP) projects were listed, with capacities of 200 MW and 20 MW. ⁷ One potential problem is that the small size of Kazakh projects limits the interest of foreign investors (see Figure 4.3 Auctions for renewable energy projects, 2018-23). Larger projects tend to be more cost-eﬀective because of economies of scale: building and operating larger solar or wind projects is often more eﬃcient than having multiple smaller projects. Also, banks and investors also tend to prefer larger projects that oﬀer more stable income streams.Changes in the underlying legislation may also aﬀect the attractiveness of renewable energy investment. From 1 July 2023, Kazakhstan implemented a centralized system for purchasing and selling electricity. This new system was created to quickly address any imbalances in the energy system, overcome electricity shortages, and promote fair competition. However, some aspects of the new rules might require further calibration. In the past, producers of"}

For intermittent renewable energy sources where output can be quite variable, this could be a signi\u0000cant burden. Still, renewable energy projects do enjoy preferential terms that are not available to other types of power projects. However, the RES build-out in Kazakhstan may have reached a temporary saturation point, owing to the need for grid reliability and a \u0000exible capacity to catch up with increased RES capacity. Investing in renewable energy projects in Kazakhstan can be a challenge for foreign investors due to the currency risks. Renewable projects require a signi\u0000cant amount of initial capital investment and often involve imported technologies, equipment, and components purchased in foreign currencies. But the primary source of income for renewable energy projects is the sale of electricity in tenge under a long-term contract with the Financial Settlement Center. Although the government of Kazakhstan has implemented an annual indexing of electricity prices in tenge for renewable projects, it may not be suﬃcient since indexation occurs only once a year on 1 October. ⁸ Long-term investments in renewable energy projects require income predictability. ⁹ 8 There are two options (formulas) to consider when deciding on annual indexation: (1) based on the consumer price index, or (2) based on the exchange rate. It is important to note that the indexing formula is only selected once when the power purchase agreement is made and is applied throughout the entire duration of the agreement; see https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P2200000704 . 9 An intergovernmental agreement has been signed between Kazakhstan and T otalEnergies for a 1 GW wind project, with a 25-year PPA and presumably a dollar-denominated tariﬀ; https://totalenergies.com/media/news/press- releases/kazakhstan-totalenergies-signs-25-year-ppa-1-gw-wind-project . 6 Eﬀective 1 July 2023, new RES projects in Kazakhstan will no longer be eligible for this exemption; see https://www.gov.kz/memleket/entities/energo/press/news/details/564150?lang=ru. 7 Both HPP projects in 2022 were not implemented. In the past three years, HPP projects have only taken 10-20% of the capacities on oﬀer.

All four have enunciated net-zero carbon goals—by 2050 for the EU and United States, and 2060 for mainland China (People's Republic of China or PRC) and Russia. How they are moving to attain this objective, however, diﬀers widely: ► Mainland China and the EU have comprehensive decarbonization plans encompassing a large number of speci\u0000c programs: the “1+ N” decarbonization framework in the PRC and the “Fit for 55” plan in the EU. The Chinese program relies largely on strong central guidance (state-led capitalism) as the vehicle for moving the economy toward lower carbon emissions, whereas the EU plan is focused heavily on regulation. ► The US approach, in contrast, is less comprehensive and more market-inspired—there is no single decarbonization plan. It is based largely on incentives for adoption of clean energy technologies (tax credits and subsidies) provided in the recently enacted In\u0000ation Reduction Act rather than solely regulation; the latter mostly occurs within pre-existing frameworks—the US Environmental Protection Agency's proposed regulations for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in electricity generation, emissions standards for new automobiles, and methane emissions regulations, for example. ► The Russian approach seems to be an opportunistic combination of strategies that leverage existing comparative advantages: abundant natural gas resources that can be exported (or used in the production of grey hydrogen for export) to countries wishing to use less-dirty fuels in power generation (e.g., coal in China); forest management (land use, land-use change, and forestry [LULUCF]) as a carbon emissions oﬀset; and some domestic industry emissions reductions associated with energy eﬃciency improvements. The latter (eﬃciency) strategy has now been complicated by recent restrictions on imports of advanced Western energy technologies (such as gas turbines in power generation). The remainder of this section outlines each of these approaches to decarbonization in the context of their relevance for policymakers in Kazakhstan. 4.3.1 China's “1 + N” policy framework relies strongly on state guidance Mainland China's “1 + N” policy framework for decarbonization is designed to mobilize resources and coordinate state policy in a centrally directed eﬀort to achieve a medium-term goal along China's ultimate trajectory to net zero in 2060- to achieve peak carbon emissions before 2030. China's decarbonization challenge is unique among countries of the world in that it is simultaneously: (a) the world's largest GHG emitter, accounting for 31% of global emissions; (b) the world's largest consumer of coal (more than all other countries in the world combined); and (c) the \u0000rst country in the world to deploy renewables on a massive scale, building more solar, wind, and other renewable energy capacity than all other countries combined. ¹⁰ 10 New York"}

Mainland China's national emissions trading system (ETS) is the world's largest compliance carbon market by volumes of emissions covered. Oﬃcially launched on 16 July 2021, it is a key decarbonization policy instrument complementing other types of “command-and- control” measures in the “1 + N” framework. Currently only C О₂ emissions from thermal electric power plants are covered in the ETS; they will continue to receive allowances free of charge in the second compliance cycle, which extends two years from 2022 to 2023, covering emissions in 2021 and 2022. After 2023, these free allowances will be gradually reduced based on evaluation of actual emissions, exposing ineﬃcient generators to carbon cost penalties. Power plants at the lower end of the eﬃciency spectrum most likely will be pushed into operating de\u0000cits and eventually could be forced to close. The expansion of the ETS more broadly into the economy, beyond the power generation sector, is likely to be delayed to 2024 or later. Nonetheless, by that time the ETS should begin to play an important role in the movement toward emissions peaking and subsequently reduction. ¹² Three speci\u0000c goals of the “1 + N” policy framework to 2030 are: ► Increasing the share of non–fossil fuel energy sources (renewables, hydroelectric power, nuclear power) in the primary energy mix to 25% ► Reducing the carbon intensity of economic output to 65% of the 2005 level ► Increasing the aggregate installed capacity of wind and solar power to 1200 GW (from about 760 GW in 2022).

{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_NationalReport23_en_64", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\NationalReport23_en.pdf", "text": "a broad array of climate action programs under the rubric of a more speci\u0000c clean-energy goal—to deliver a 55% GHG emissions reduction by 2030 (relative to 1990), aimed at generating momentum to put the bloc on track for attaining its net-zero emissions target in 2050. ¹⁴ Although both the EU and Chinese frameworks seek to jump-start longer-term climate action by \u0000rst mobilizing to achieve shorter-term 2030 objectives, the focus of “Fit for 55” is more about establishing eﬀective regulatory frameworks. Enacted on 14 July 2021, “Fit for 55” will shape EU power, gas, and emerging hydrogen markets through 2030 and beyond. It represents a “doubling down” of already ambitious previous decarbonization goals embodied in the European Green Deal (adopted on 12 December 2019)—the core long-term EU strategy to \u0000ght climate change and achieve climate neutrality—by mandating: ► a 50% more stringent emissions reduction target in the carbon market ► a 25% higher mandate for renewable energy use in overall energy consumption ► new mandates to purchase renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) ► accelerated energy eﬃciency improvements ► the extension of carbon pricing to buildings and transport and to importers into the EU of certain products (CBAM). “Fit for 55” unites \u0000ve EU programs dedicated to emissions reduction, the renewable energy build-out, and energy eﬃciency: the EU Emissions Trading System, New Carbon Market, CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism), Renewable Energy Directive II, and Energy Eﬃciency Directive.4.3.2.1 Emissions reduction The emissions reduction programs encompassed by “Fit for 55” include the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), a new carbon market that will cover emissions from buildings and transportation (New Carbon Market), and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) that will extend EU ETS emissions standards to goods of speci\u0000ed products imported into the EU from non-member countries. The EU ETS , launched in 2005, involves the acceleration of the original ETS timetable for emissions reduction. Under “Fit for 55,” the ETS now envisages a 62% emissions reduction within the system (relative to 2005) by 2030, compared to 43% previously. This is to be achieved by a combination of measures, including: ► Reducing the market cap of free allocations by an equivalent of 5.2% annually from 2024 to 2030, up from 2.2% currently. ► Adding the maritime sector to the market partially from 2024 and fully from 2026. ► Setting a timeline for the expiry of free allocation to installations in key industrial sectors. The electric power, cement, iron and steel, aluminum, hydrogen, ammonia, and fertilizers sectors will start to see a progressive reduction of the number of allowances they receive for free from 2026 (when CBAM takes full eﬀect). By 2030, these sectors will get just over 50% free allocation, and by 2034 free allocation will have ended. The New Carbon Market for buildings and road transport (not linked to the EU ETS) will begin operations in 2027. A free emissions allowance (adjusted annually) will be assigned to suppliers of fuel (e.g., gas, diesel, gasoline) to these sectors, who will pay a carbon price for emissions above this allowance. During a pilot phase (2024–27) the free allowance cap will decrease by 5.15% each year, and then by 5.43% annually in the compliance phase that will begin in in 2028. This is designed to provide a soft carbon price ceiling at €45 per metric ton (real 2020), and incorporates a price adjustment mechanism that will allow the release of additional free allowances into the market should the carbon price exceed this ceiling. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), described in detail in Chapter 2, went into eﬀect in May 2023. CBAM will impose a fee, starting in 2026, on imports of selected products into the EU commensurate with the degree to which GHG emissions from the production of these products exceeds a speci\u0000ed norm (based on emissions from the 10% of EU companies in the same industry reporting the highest emissions per unit of output). The sectoral coverage includes eight industries—electric power, cement, fertilizers, aluminum, iron- steel, hydrogen, ammonia, and downstream iron-steel products (e.g., screws, bolts, etc. fabricated from iron and steel). The goal is to: ► Encourage countries seeking to export goods to the EU market to adopt the EU's greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions reduction strategies in the production of those goods ► Protect domestic EU industries from “unfair” competition from imported goods produced without heed for those emissions reduction strategies 13 China's Carbon Ambitions , p. 24. 14 Information about \"Fit for 55\" is largely derived from S&P Global Commodity Insights, Regional Integrated Insight, \"Fit for 55\": Final package claries path for transformation of Europe's energy mix by 2030, April 2023. KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 90 ► Prevent “carbon leakage” from the EU—the re-location of European production volumes to countries with less strict carbon regimes, either as a result of the physical relocation of production capacity outside the EU or by ceding market share to “dirtier” producers as a result of the closure of European capacity. 4.3.2.2 Boosting renewable energy: RED II The Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II, 2021) program accelerates the timetable for renewable energy build-out from its predecessor (RED I, 2018) by setting an extremely high renewable energy target and providing demand for renewable hydrogen and its derivatives. More speci\u0000cally, it sets a binding target for renewable energy at 42.5% of total energy in the EU by 2030 (a near-doubling from the recent share of 21.8% in 2021 and fully 10 percentage points higher than the RED I target of 32%), to be achieved through a series of more speci\u0000c sub-targets in particular sectors of the economy: ► Buildings: At least 49% of energy in buildings in the EU must come from renewables. ► Industry: 42% of hydrogen used in industry should be produced from renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) in 2030, rising to 60% in 2035 (the directive eﬀectively replaces 42% of industry's grey hydrogen demand with green [RFNBO-generated] hydrogen); industry increases overall use of renewable energy by"}

In addition, there is a binding sub-target for advanced biofuels and RFNBO of 5.5% in renewable energy consumed in transport, of which 1% at least must be RFNBO. ► Biomass in electric power: Financial support will no longer be available for biomass power plants, unless equipped with carbon capture and storage or located in certain regions. 4.3.2.3 Increasing energy eﬃciency: EED The EU's Energy Eﬃciency Directive (EED, 2012; amended 2018) seeks to complement other elements of “Fit for 55” by specifying rules and obligations for achieving the EU's 2030 energy eﬃciency targets. It calls for a reduction of \u0000nal EU energy demand by 11.7% (from 2020) in 2030, which implies a quintupling ( \u0000vefold) increase in historical (2005–21) EU eﬃciency gains, to 2.6% per year to 2030. National contributions will be set by member states; they are indicative and a 2.5% margin is allowed. The directive makes limited proposals as to how this target will be achieved beyond the usual language about the public sector leading by example; speci\u0000c proposals include the obligation of large energy consumers to implement an energy management system and small and medium-sized enterprises to conduct energy audits. ¹⁶ Consequently, delivery of the energy eﬃciency target is expected to come largely through other EU policy initiatives.4.3.3 United States: Piecemeal approach relies on new legislative incentives and the existing regulatory framework Unlike mainland China and the European Union, the United States lacks a single, overarching decarbonization strategy. It instead relies on (a) sweeping new legislation—the In\u0000ation Reduction Act (IRA)—to provide incentives for clean-energy development and (b) changes to the existing emissions regulatory framework (administered by the US Environmental Protection Agency) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The United States is now the world's second-largest GHG emitter, accounting for 14% of total global emissions, and plans to reduce emissions by 50%–52% below 2005 levels by 2030, along its projected pathway to net zero emissions by 2050. 4.3.3.1 Ination Reduction Act The IRA, enacted on 16 August 2022, earmarks—as part of an estimated massive $433 billion spending package—$386 billion in tax credits and subsidies for renewables and other green energy technologies over a 10-year period. This long window of time is intended to reduce the level of uncertainty among potential investors about whether funding will be available for a suﬃcient period to ensure the viability of new projects. Among the more noteworthy climate and energy incentives contained in the IRA: ► $161 billion in clean electricity tax credits (e.g., construction of new zero-carbon power generation capacity, conversion of existing capacity, renovation) ► $40 billion in new transportation and infrastructure spending, as well as pollution and hazardous materials mitigation ► $37 billion each for clean-energy incentives for individual citizens and for domestic clean-energy manufacturing —incentives for companies to build solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries and to process clean-energy minerals (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel) in the United States ► $36 billion in clean fuel and clean vehicle tax credits, including a $7,500 tax credit for car buyers with income below a certain threshold to purchase a new electric vehicle, and a $4,000 credit for used vehicle purchases ¹⁷ ► $35 billion for programs to reduce emissions in the agricultural sector, forest management, and resource conservation (LULUCF) 15 Hydrogen made using nuclear power can be used to meet 20% of the industry RFNBO hydrogen target. 16 https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-eﬃciency/energy-eﬃciency- targets-directive-and-rules/energy-eﬃciency-directive_en . 17 The tax credits are subject to personal income limits on the purchaser ($150,000 taxable income for single \u0000lers and $300,000 for joint \u0000lers) and domestic content requirements for the vehicles, such as for batteries. They also apply only to passenger sedans with sales prices not exceeding $55,000 and to pickup trucks, vans, and sport-utility vehicles with prices no higher than $80,000 ( New York Times , 13 August 2022).

In the case of power plant emissions this is an approach borne of necessity, after the US Supreme Court in July 2022 struck down the EPA's authority to enforce provisions of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan (2015) mandating the closure of coal-\u0000red power plants. But it has the practical advantage of working within the pre-existing administrative framework for emissions regulation in the country. The Clean Power Plan had sought to reduce power sector emissions by 32% by 2030 (from 2005 levels), by mandating states submit plans for phasing out coal-\u0000red power generation and increasing renewable generation. The Plan was stayed (tempo- rarily blocked) in 2016 by the Supreme Court to allow a multitude of legal challenges by the states to be heard. In a \u0000nal 2022 decision on the Clean Power Plan, the Court in eﬀect ruled that the Clean Air Act enacted by Congress (1963, and as subse- quently amended) did not clearly delegate to the EPA such broad regulatory authority over the structure (fuel mix) of the power sector. However, the ruling left intact the EPA's authority to regulate emissions in the sector, so on 11 May 2023 the Agency sought to reduce power sector GHG emissions via a diﬀerent, more limited mechanism, releasing various emissions reduction targets for power plants based on size, mode of operation (regular or intermittent), and age (e.g., new vs. scheduled for retirement). Rather than identifying speci\u0000c generation modes for develop- ment or"}

The EPA does recommend a “best system of emissions reduction” (BSER) for various categories of plants, which in some cases may be carbon capture (coal plants with long future service lives), co -\u0000ring with gas (coal plants with intermediate future service lives), or routine operations (natural gas plants, coal plants scheduled for closure). ¹⁹ But it no longer seeks to expressly regulate the mode (power source) of generation. Similar to the Clean Power Plan, the proposed new emissions regulations are not guaranteed to take eﬀect: they will also face legal challenges, and there is the possibility of being overturned by the Congressional Review Act pending the results of the 2024 elections in the United States, or some future presidential administration could simply decide to weaken them. 4.3.3.3 New vehicle emissions standards In the United States, the transportation sector is the leading source of carbon pollution, accounting for 29% of the country's total GHG emissions. ²⁰ Consequently, emissions reduction in this sector will be crucial for any eﬀort by the country to achieve its net-zero goals. In April 2021, the Biden administration and EPA announced new tailpipe emissions standards for new vehicles, with the informal goal of accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). The intended eﬀect of the new standards is for 67% of all new light-duty passenger vehicles, 46% of medium-duty delivery vehicles (medium-sized trucks and vans), and one quarter of all heavy trucks sold in the United States to be electric powered by 2032. The approach followed by the EPA in achieving this objective in eﬀect represents a “lesson learned” from its eﬀorts to transform the electric power industry. Rather than explicitly mandating a switch from fossil f uel–\u0000red internal combustion engines, the Agency instead has opted to tighten tailpipe emissions regulations so strongly that the only way automobile manufacturers can realistically achieve compliance is by switching most of their production to EVs. ²¹ The EPA is empowered to set limits on the pollution generated by the new vehicles automobile manufactur- ers produce. The new rules are set to take eﬀect in 2027. However, similar to electric power regulation eﬀorts, they will face legal challenges. In addition, the sheer scale of industry transformation (plant retooling, worker retraining, supply chain adjustments) will be massive. 4.3.3.4 Methane emissions standards A third major prong in EPA regulatory eﬀorts to reduce GHG emissions is methane reduction. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that traps about 80 times as much heat as C О₂, on average, over the \u0000rst 20 years after reaching the atmosphere, and is believed to be responsible for approximately one-third of the present atmospheric warming from GHGs. Sharp cuts in methane emissions therefore are among the most critical actions available to slow the rate of climate change over the near term. On 11 November 2022, at the COP27 climate summit in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, the EPA announced it was strengthening its proposed standards to cut methane and other related pollutants such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The stronger standards are intended to reduce methane emissions by 87% below 2005 levels by 2030. ²² The updated regulations, which supplement proposed standards the EPA released in November 2021 that extended to oil and gas wells nationwide, provide more comprehensive requirements to reduce methane emissions from hundreds of thousands of 18 New York Times , 3 August 2022; https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/in \u0000ation- reduction-act-guidebook/ ; https://www.crfb.org/blogs/whats-in \u0000ation-reduction-act. 19 For details, see S&P Global, Global Power and Renewables Insight, US EPA Releases Long-Awaited GHG Regulations for Fossil Fuel–Fired Power Plants, 12 May 2023. 20 https://www.epa.gov/transportation-air-pollution-and-climate-change/carbon- pollution -transportation#:~:text=%E2%80%8BGreenhouse%20gas%20(GHG)%20 emissions,contributor%20of%20U.S.%20GHG%20emissions . 21 In the electric power sector, as noted immediately above in section 4.2.3.2, the US Supreme Court ruled that the EPA did not have the authority to mandate that electric power be produced (or banned) from a speci\u0000c power source, but upheld its authority to regulate emissions in the sector. 22 https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-strengthens- proposal-cut-methane-pollution-protect.KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 92 sources nationwide. More speci\u0000cally, the new rules now apply to all drilling sites, including smaller wells that emit less than 3 tons of methane per year. Small wells currently are subject to an initial inspection but are rarely checked again for leaks. Multiple studies have found that smaller wells produce just 6% of US oil and gas but account for up to half the methane emissions from well sites. ²³ The new regulations also would promote the use of advanced methane detection technologies and establish a Super-Emitter Response Program that would leverage data from regulatory agencies or approved third parties with expertise in remote methane detection technology to quickly identify large-scale emissions for prompt control. Although the proposed new standards are subject to review by a variety of stakeholders, oil and gas industry oﬃcials have recently been receptive to national- level EPA regulation, preferring a single regulatory framework to a hodgepodge of state-level rules. In an auxiliary proposal aimed at improving methane leak detection over much of the nation's natural gas transportation and distribution infrastructure, the US Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) on 5 May 2023 announced that was updating old leak detection and repair standards on pipelines, underground storage sites, and LNG facilities. ²⁴ The proposed rule, as mandated under the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020, would deploy pipeline workers across the country to keep more product in the pipe and prevent dangerous accidents. T o improve leak detection the proposal calls for using new methane leak detection and repair technologies. Federal leak detection and repair standards for gas pipelines have remained largely unchanged since the 1970s despite signi\u0000cant improvements in leak detection technology and operator practices over the past \u0000ve decades. If the new standards go into eﬀect, they are expected to reduce emissions from pipelines by as much as 55%."}

The proposed standards are currently under review. 4.3.4 Russian Federation: Limited actions leverage comparative advantages and emphasize carbon oﬀsets Russia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Climate Agreement pledges a 30% reduction of GHG emissions below 1990 levels by 2030. In October 2021, ahead of the COP26 summit in Edinburgh, Scotland, the Russian government announced a new decarbonization strategy—the “Strategy of Socio-economic Development with low GHG Emissions until 2050”—that includes for the \u0000rst time a net zero emissions pledge (2060) and more aggressive measures to tackle emissions than previously. ²⁵ The new net-zero target represents a signi\u0000cant departure from Russia's previous plans, which would have seen emissions increase through 2050 and not drop to net-zero until the following century. ²⁶ Under the new strategy, Russia as the world's sixth-largest carbon emitter (after China, the United States, India, the EU, and Indonesia) will endeavor to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 70% from 1990 levels (and 60% from 2019 levels) by 2050 in an “intensive” scenario that serves as its base case. ²⁷ The new strategy's intensive scenario includes the following major elements: ► A shift of electric power generation away from coal-\u0000red power plants toward gas turbines, nuclear, hydroelectric, and renewable power facilities; for the coal-\u0000red capacity that remains, there will be greater utilization of “clean coal” technologies, including CCUS. ²⁸ ► A moderate, but not decisive turn away from fossil fuel exports to support decarbonization eﬀorts. The new strategy envisions a continued reliance on oil and gas exports, but such exports are expected to decline in real terms at an average annual rate of 2.1% after 2030; the revenue impacts are expected to be mitigated by the export of a higher share of products with greater value-added. ²⁹ 2019 2030 2050 Actual (total) GHG emissions 2,119 2,112 1,830 Absorption by LULUCF -535 -539 -1,200 Net GHG emissions 1,584 1,673 630 Absolute change, 2019-50 289 665 954Table 4.1 Actual and Net GHG Emissions and Absorption in the Intensive Emissions Scenario, 2019, 2030, and 2050 (MMtCO ₂e) Source: Strategy of Socio-economic Development with low GHG Emissions until 2050, Appendix. © 2023 S&P Global. 23 https://apnews.com/article/biden-business-prices-oil-and-gas-industry- climate-environment-3a5b7049478ec7161fcbd18f1ebdb0ba. 24 https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/05/18/2023-09918/pipeline- s a f e t y - g a s - p i p e l i n e - l e a k - d e t e c t i o n - a n d - repair#:~:text=PHMSA%20proposes%20to%20require%20that,leakage%20sur veys%20and%20leak%20investigations . 25 The decarbonization strategy was approved by Russian Federation Government Decree No. 3052-R of 29 October 2021, https://www.iea.org/ policies/14859-strategy-of-socio-economic-development-of-russia-with-a-low- level-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-until-2050 . 26 https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/10/13/russia-aiming-for-carbon- neutrality-by-2060-putin-says-a75284. 27 A second, \"inertial\" scenario models a business-as-usual approach. 28 It should be noted that such a shift in generation would not represent a particularly dramatic divergence from the present situation, as the share of coal in Russia's recent electric power generation (through 9M 2022) is only 13.8%, compared to 47.1% for gas, 20.1% for nuclear; 18.2% for hydro, and less than 1% each for wind, solar, and \"other thermal\" (largely mazut). Russia's electricity sector therefore already has a relatively low carbon footprint. 29 Part of the strategy's reliance on exports as part of a decarbonization eﬀort appears to r e\u0000ect a belief (or hope) that imports by countries of relatively less dirty fuels (e.g., Russian natural gas) potentially at some future date might be counted as carbon oﬀsets to the extent they displace demand for still dirtier fuels (e.g., coal, traditional biomass) in the importing countries. This thinking appears to extend also to the potential development of grey, blue, or green hydrogen exports. KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 93 ► Increased digitalization and elec tri\u0000cation in all sectors of the economy, especially elec tri\u0000cation of transportation such as mass transit. ► Increased consumption of hydrogen by industry, especially in metallurgy and chemicals production, and creation of a hydrogen export industry. ► Improvements of energy eﬃciency in all sectors of the economy; establishment of energy eﬃciency standards for new construction and renovation of buildings as well as for sectors within industry. The plan calls for an overall reduction in the energy intensity of the economy by half (to the level of “leading countries”) by 2050; part of this will be accomplished by structural shifts in the economy in the direction of “post- industrial” sectors, accompanied by an increase in these sectors' share of overall GDP by 11.8 percentage points. ► Implementation of a host of ancillary supporting measures in \u0000scal policy, Best Available T echnologies (BAT) adoption, and clean-energy \u0000nancial incentives. But carbon oﬀsets—particularly absorption of carbon in the land use/land use change and forestry (LULCF) sector—are the most important component of the new strategy. Russia's vast forested lands are viewed as the primary resource for climate change action through planned improvements in silvicultural practices (i.e., conversion of unmanaged forests to managed forests), active forestation eﬀorts, and wild\u0000re control. Indeed, Russia's LULUCF sector has been a large emissions sink since the mid-1990s, reaching a maximum of -720 MMtCO ₂e in 2010 (36% of total non-LULUCF GHG emissions) although subsequently falling to - 569 MMtCO ₂e in 2020, the latest year of inventory data. ³⁰ Under the new plan, the Russian government appears to be relying on an expectation that its researchers, or those in the international community, will be able to provide science-based evidence that current net sinks in LULUCF are greatly underestimated and can substantially and cost eﬀectively be scaled up in the future. Through these mechanisms (re-estimation of the magnitude of its LULUCF sink and the ability to ramp up silvicultural management and reforestation), the strategy to 2050 explicitly targets a more than doubling of LULUCF carbon absorption in Russia, from an estimated 535 MMtCO ₂e in 2019 to 1,200 MMtCO ₂e in 2050 (see Table 4.1 Actual and Net GHG Emissions and Absorption in the Intensive Emissions Scenario, 2019, 2030, and 2050). Under this scenario,"}

Western sanctions now greatly impede Russia's access to some advanced technologies used to improve energy eﬃciency and reduce emissions. As a further consequence of Western sanctions, a key support mechanism for the build-out of renewable generation capacity in Russia introduced in 2021—the Capacity Supply Agreement 2.0 (CSA RES 2.0), whereby domestic and foreign investors bid on long-term contracts to build capacity to deliver electricity at a \u0000xed cost per kilowatt-hour—was suspended in the wholesale and retail markets until April 2023. ³⁴ Despite the imposition of sanctions, Russia’s formal decarbonization goals (as enunciated in the Strategy of Socio- Economic Development with low GHG Emissions until 2050) have so far remained intact. Climate policy is one of the few venues remaining open for dialogue with the West, and by maintaining its climate pledges and remaining in the Paris Climate Agreement Russia can leverage this participation to argue for the relaxation of sanctions on the grounds that this will strengthen its response to climate change. However, much of the momentum toward decarbonization remains jeopardized. For instance, it is no longer clear what will be Russia’s path forward in responding to international carbon trading initiatives such as CBAM, which might entail introducing a nationwide emissions trading system and will likely aﬀect its eﬀorts to become a major hydrogen exporter. At present, emissions trading in Russia occurs only in a pilot phase in a single region—Sakhalin Oblast—although a federal law extending emissions trading on an experimental basis to additional regions was enacted in September 2022. Furthermore, the long-term viability of a decarbonization strategy based at least in part on continued natural gas and potential future hydrogen exports now appears to be complicated by both: (a) the long-term downward trend of global demand for natural gas, which peaks around 2040 (Chapter 1); and (b) the current logistical and geopolitical diﬃculties such exports face as a result of the loss of Russia’s former (EU) markets and the reorientation of its energy \u0000ows toward the east (Chapters 2, 5, and 6). 4.3.5 Kazakhstan's Low-Carbon Development Strategy to 2060 in comparative perspective Similar to mainland China, the European Union, and the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan has a speci\u0000c document that serves as a decarbonization roadmap toward attaining its net-zero GHG emissions goal: the aforementioned Low-Carbon Development Strategy (to 2060), adopted in February 2023.

KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 94 Development Strategy outlines speci \u0000c targets for gross emissions, absorption (LULUCF), and net emissions for the country for key mileposts in 2030, 2040, 2050, and 2060. That said, the Low-Carbon Development Strategy is largely a set of concepts (on how to get to net zero) rather than an action plan as such; it does not really elaborate on how existing programs and agencies \u0000t within the grand plan and will coordinate their activities under its framework. However, this potential shortcoming is mitigated by the fact that Kazakhstan has now established a broad complement of programs and institutions for decarbonization (described in Section 4.2.1), including both regulatory and incentives-based approaches: ► An ETS that now covers roughly half of national GHG emissions ► The Development Strategy until 2050 and the Concept for the Transition to a Green Economy, which set targets for a 50% increase in energy eﬃciency and increased use of renewable energy (to 50% of the total) by 2050 ► Financial incentives for the clean-energy build-out, outlined in the Investment Policy Concept to 2026 and the Law on Support for the Use of Renewable Energy Sources. The task going forward will be to: (a) ensure the necessary intergovernmental coordination in implementation of these programs; and, within each program, (b) to foster the development of eﬀective regulations and \u0000nancial incentives. In the following sections of this chapter, we outline some approaches for attaining these goals.4.4 Improving Kazakhstan's Emissions Trading System 4.4.1 Overview of Kazakhstan's carbon trading scheme Kazakhstan's carbon trading scheme, known oﬃcially as Sistema torgovli kvotami na vybrosy parnikovykh gazov, is usually referred to as Kazakhstan's greenhouse gas emissions trading system (ETS). Kazakhstan's ETS is a classic “cap and trade” system that exclusively handles only C О₂ emissions. It is viewed as a key instrument in reducing GHG emissions and eventually achieving carbon neutrality by 2060."}

Under the National Allowance Allocation Plan (NAAP) for 2013, a cap (allowance surrender obligation) was placed on the aggregate GHG emissions of these 178 enterprises that corresponded to their 2010 emissions (147.2 MMtCO ₂).⁴¹ The general concept was that enterprises that failed to hold their emissions at the 2010 level could purchase allowances from those with credits to spare, or would be subjec t to \u0000nes. Ultimately, however , no \u0000nes were imposed on enterprises for non-compliance during the pilot phase. The only penalties imposed were for failure to submit the required documentation and reports. 4.4.1.2 Kazakhstan's ETS: Phase 2 Despite the technical and organizational challenges of the pilot phase, the ETS was extended in 2014 — this time in an operating mode, envisaging penalties for enterprises exceeding the established emissions limits or purchases of additional allowances. According to the NAAP for 2014–15, allocations were issued to 166 companies using 2013 emissions data as a benchmark (with commitments to maintain the same level of emissions in 2014 and to achieve a 1.5% reduction in 2015). The quotas were extended to 60 entities in the power sector with allocations of 184.6 MMtCO ₂, 66 entities in the oil-gas and coal mining sectors, with allocations of 46.5 MMtCO ₂, and 40 entities in chemicals and metals mining/metallurgical sectors with allocations of 76.5 MMtCO ₂ (see Figure 4.7 Phase 2: National Allowance Allocation Plan for 2014–15). Enterprises exceeding their allowances could purchase additional GHG emissions quotas on Kazakhstan's \"Caspi\" commodity exchange (CCX). ⁴² A controversial matter at that time involved the issuance by the market administrator (Zhasyl Damu) of additional free allocations to enterprises based on applications received that r e\u0000ected plans to increase industrial output or to put into operation new emission sources.

Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global. 40 According to the Article 300 of the Environmental Code, each installation listed in National Allowance Allocation Plan has a corresponding account created in the State Register of Carbon Units, an electronic transactions tracking system, where carbon quotas are registered and subsequent transactions recorded. All transactions with carbon units (purchases, sale, redemption, removal, acquisition of additional allowances on the basis of increased production, and/or capacity upgrades) are recorded in the State Register. 41 An additional reserve of allowances of 20.6 MMtCO₂ was set aside for the expected installation of new capacity (and higher production) at these enterprises in 2013; see National Allowance Allocation Plan for 2013 at https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P1200001588. 42 Carbon trading on the CCX currently is suspended, as a result of amendments to the Law “On Commodity Exchanges,” where Article 13-3 states that from 1 January 2023, only a specially authorized commodity exchange can trade carbon units, https://adilet.zan.kz/eng/docs/Z090000155_. The Ministry of Ecology is reportedly in the process of selecting such a specialized exchange. KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 97 were raised about the fairness and transparency of the mechanism for allocating these additional quotas, because not all applicants received additional quotas for their new emission sources. Questions arose concerning the quotas being traded on the market during Phase 2 (2014–15) when national coal output declined, electricity generation fell at certain power stations, and industrial output overall was relatively weak. This led some researchers to suspect that a portion of the quotas being sold by enterprises only r e\u0000ected reduced output (and therefore reduced emissions). Although such sales are clearly prohibited by the Environmental Code, the mechanism for enforcement was inadequate: enterprises registering allowances on the trading platform were not required to report the reason they had allowances available (i.e., the actual causes for their emission reductions). The extent of such activity became even more diﬃcult to determine following a Ministry of Energy decree of 18 March 2015, which stated that quota allocations for enterprises could be subsequently revised to r e\u0000ect: (a) changes planned in the basic character and functioning of the enterprise; and (b) the introduction of new production capacity that increases output. The lack of suﬃciently precise criteria regarding interpretation of the \u0000rst provision allowed some enterprises to rationalize production cuts as \"changes in the character of production.\" In the lead-up to 2016, the government began work on revising the quota allocation system, and on 30 December 2015 it issued Decree No. 1138 \"On Con\u0000rmation of a National Plan for the Allocation of Quotas for Emissions of Greenhouse Gases for 2016–2020,\" intended to supplement previous legislation and to go into force on 1 January 2016. However, the problems outlined above had not been adequately addressed, and on 26 December 2017 the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan issued a Decree No. 873 cancelling the National GHG Emission Allowance Allocation Plan for 2016-2020. The decision was intended to give all parties additional time — for the government to make r e\u0000nements to the system and for the industrial enterprises to make further adjustments and preparations. Although enforcement eﬀorts were suspended, the country's Environmental Code required all enterprises (accounting for roughly 50% of total CO ₂ emissions) covered by the ETS' Phase 2 to continue to report their emissions, including emissions of C Н₄, N₂O, and PFCs. While only CO ₂ has been regulated and traded within the system to date. If additional gases are to be traded and regulated in the future, these should be clearly speci\u0000ed and uniformly de\u0000ned in legislation. 4.4.1.3 Kazakhstan's ETS: Phase 3 In the 2018 relaunch of the ETS, quotas were granted for the three-year period of 2018–20 (rather than speci\u0000ed as annual caps). ⁴³ Quota use for each company could be dispersed over the three years, but any unused quotas could not be transferred or rolled over to subsequent phases. With Phase 3, an additional sector was added to the ETS — the production of construction materials"}

Also starting in 2018, quota allocations were made to speci\u0000c technical installations rather than to enterprises or entities (see Figure 4.8 Phase 3: National Allowance Allocation Plan for 2018–20). Another important change to the ETS in 2018 was that participants were able to select a mechanism by which their free quota allocations were made: either according to the historical \"baseline\" method utilized previously or through a benchmarking procedure. The latter, based on a practice in the EU ETS, designates best practice in low-emission production as a benchmark when setting an enterprise's free allocation. The benchmarks are product speci\u0000c to the extent possible. In a general sense, in the EU system, the benchmark is based on the average GHG emission performance of the top 10% (best- performing) installations producing a speci \u0000c product. Installations that meet these benchmarks in principle receive all of the allowances needed; enterprises that do not would be required to purchase additional allowances to cover their higher emissions. The diﬃculty of this approach lies in the dependence of emissions in speci\u0000c industries on the load (in the case of thermal power plants or combined heat-and-power plants) or widely varying geologic and \u0000eld conditions (in the case of coal mining or oil and gas extraction). In 2021, Kazakhstan adopted 52 of its own benchmarks for speci\u0000c GHG emissions rates. ⁴⁴ It appears that benchmarks were calculated on the basis of the average production volumes and emissions of each product in 2013–15. Benchmarking is likely to remain challenging for the power sector, where generation is mainly coal-\u0000red and highly outdated, resulting in a high carbon emissions intensity (C О₂ per kilowatt-hour generated). T o reduce its environmental impact (and to improve overall reliability and economic performance), the power sector badly needs general modernization and investment in speci \u0000c low-carbon technologies. However, government-regulated tariﬀs make it diﬃcult for generating companies to \u0000nance investment and aﬀord such technologies. Given that much of Kazakhstan's generating assets are quite old, a key issue is to develop suﬃciently ambitious yet attainable benchmarks for emissions. ⁴⁵ Power generating companies have major concerns about the scheduled contraction in their overall emission allowances. They already are struggling with \u0000nancing modernization, so purchasing additional quotas to cover any excess emissions will lead to additional \u0000nancial costs that are not covered by current electricity wholesale prices. It appears that to help these companies prepare for the tightening of the ETS quotas, the regulator has set fairly generous benchmarks. For coal-\u0000red electricity generation, for example, the benchmark is 0.985 tCO₂/MWh. For comparison, in 2019, Ekibastuz GRES-1, one of Kazakhstan's largest coal-\u0000red plants (producing about 18% of national electricity output in 2020), had an emission level of 0.925 tCO₂/MWh. Between 2019 and 2021, Ekibastuz GRES-1, through a series of eﬃciency measures, reduced its emissions to 0.919 tCO₂/MWh in 2020 and 0.904 tCO ₂/MWh in 2021, an 8% improvement over three years. ⁴⁶ 43 See National Allowance Allocation Plan for 2018–20 at https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P1700000873. 44 Decree of acting Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources #260 dated 19 July 2021, https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/V2100023621. 45 See S&P Global Commodity Insights, Lots of sticks and few carrots: BAT implementation in the energy sector within Kazakhstan's new Ecology Code, November 2021. 46 See Project of Allowable emission norms of \"Ekibastuz GRES-1 after Bulat Nurzhanov\" for 2022–25, https://ecoportal.kz/Public/PubHearings/LoadFile/ 38414 .

Previously, emissions caps were raised each year, while during Phase 5 there appears to be more of a concerted eﬀort to reduce actual emissions by reducing overall allowances. According to Article 286 of the Environmental Code, an annual linear reduction factor (LRF) in Phase 5 must be no less than 1.5%, which means that annual caps must decrease by at least 1.5% compared to the previous year"}

This annual rate for the LRF will also apply to the 2026–30 period. 100 4.4.2 A special concern: Market liquidity As always with these types of trading schemes, a special concern is how to increase liquidity; that is, the volumes and overall aggregate value of total trades. The Environmental Code and State regulation rules for GHG emissions and absorption provide a framework for the operation of the market mechanism of Kazakhstan's ETS. ⁴⁹ Yet, the small size of Kazakhstan's carbon market alone presents a considerable liquidity challenge, even before considering the existing system's operations and whether the system provides suﬃcient incentives for participants to trade. First trades occurred in 2014, when only 1.27 MMtCO ₂ were traded, at an average price of 301 tenge ($1.49) per ton, followed in 2015 with 1.98 MMtCO ₂ at 830 tenge ($3.38) per ton (see Figure 4.12 Kazakhstan's ETS secondary market). In 2014 and 2015, only 35 and 40 trades were recorded, respectively; prices of the allowances were volatile and not transparent, making it hard for participants to discern meaningful trends. They ended up being much higher for oil and gas producers, ranging between 1,000 and 1,600 tenge per ton ($5.40-$8.91). As indicated above, the lack of success during the initial stages of ETS led policymakers to halt the program, r econ\u0000gure it, and relaunch it in 2018. Still, only three trades occurred in 2019 and six trades in 2020. In 2021, it appears there was a step-change in trading activity (39 trades), not only through CCX, but on other exchanges and through bilateral arrangements, as companies reconciled their emission balances for the 2018–20 period ahead of the August 2021 deadline. Companies that exceeded their emissions quotas in 2018–20 had until 12 August 2021 to compensate through market mechanisms or the direct acquisition of additional quotas, or risk incurring substantial \u0000nancial penalties. ⁵⁰ CO₂ prices in the 2019-21 trading period were on the range of $1 per ton, clearly due to low market liquidity. Only about 6.9 MMtCO ₂ were traded in 2019–21, which represents 1.4% of the total cap in Phase 3 (2018–20). In several instances, quotas were bought and sold between diﬀerent entities directly under bilateral agreements. It appears that market participants informally sought to preserve a carbon price of approximately $1 per ton. Such transactions are not contrary to law, but they undermine the entire market basis of the quota trading mechanism. 4.4.3 What is needed for Kazakhstan's ETS to become more eﬀective? Further development of Kazakhstan's ETS could make a signi\u0000cant contribution in achieving Kazakhstan's goal of reducing its carbon emissions and being carbon neutral by 2060. Kazakhstan has been operating its emissions trading system for nearly a decade now, but it currently only covers CO₂ emissions. The system does not regulate other GHGs such as C Н₄, N₂O, and PFCs. However, policymakers are considering expanding the system to include these gases, which would increase the overall coverage of GHG emissions in the country from 43% to 61%. Nonetheless, there are still many \"unregulated\" sectors in the economy that need to be addressed if the goals for reducing GHG emissions are to be met. T o achieve these goals, Kazakhstan's Low-Carbon Development Strategy envisions a creation of a Carbon Regulatory System (CRS) that would, among other things, include carbon taxation of installations (processes, goods, and services) whose emissions are not regulated under the national ETS.

KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 101 T o make Kazakhstan's ETS more eﬀective, it is important to decrease the overall cap on allowances over time. This cap determines the maximum volume of emissions allowed and is crucial to the success of other environmental policies. Annual reduction of allowances is necessary to achieve long-term decarbonization goals. ⁵¹ Auctions are the most transparent method for allocating emissions quotas, encouraging participants to consider the environmental impact of their production decisions through application of the \"polluter pays\" principle. Furthermore, auctions help to establish a carbon price, and the revenues generated can be used to support broad climate protection measures. In the EU ETS, member-states were allowed to auction a certain percentage of allowances in each phase, with approximately 57% of allowances auctioned in the now-completed third phase (2013- 20). T o date, Kazakhstan's ETS has not used auctions to allocate quotas at all, but it is probably essential to start auctioning at least some proportion of overall allowances, with that proportion increasing over time. Without auctions, there is no transparency in the Kazakh carbon market, and pricing on the secondary market will remain unclear. The eﬀectiveness of cap-and-trade systems depends heavily on the trading of allowances among companies. When there is a shortage of allowances in the market, those with extra allowances can sell them to those who most need them to comply. Conversely, an excess of allowances eﬀectively halts trading activity and leads to a low carbon price. This situation arose for the EU ETS during its second phase (2008-12); to combat this, policymakers introduced quantity-based interventions, such as the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) and a higher LRF. The MSR manages the number of allowances available in the ETS by absorbing unused allowances and keeping them oﬀ the market until needed. Since MSR implementation in Europe in 2018, allowance prices have increased, indicating a growing scarcity. This highlights the importance of \u0000exibility in cap-and-trade systems. The surplus of carbon quotas in Kazakhstan's market can also be eﬀectively addressed by implementing an MSR mechanism. This move can have a positive impact on overall market liquidity, eventually leading to the"}

Kazakhstan's ETS, which is younger than its European counterpart, introduced the LRF only recently at 1.5% for the current \u0000fth phase (2022-25). KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 102 According to the National Inventory Report (NIR) on Kazakhstan's GHG emissions in 2020, published in 2022, total GHG emissions in the country amounted to 351.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO ₂e).⁵³ T o f ul\u0000ll its unconditional INDC, Kazakhstan needs to reduce its GHG emissions by 57.3 MMt by 2030 from the 1990 level of 381.7 MMt; i.e., to 324.4 MMt of CO ₂ equivalent (CO ₂e). Hence, achieving the unconditional INDC target requires Kazakhstan to reduce emissions by approximately 3.0 MMtCO ₂e on an annual average basis from 2021 to 2030. Achieving the 25% conditional reduction in GHG emissions, to 286.3 MMtCO ₂e in 2030, necessitates emissions reductions in the amount of 7.2 MMtCO ₂e on average per year during 2021–30 (see Figure 4.13 Outlook for Kazakhstan's GHG emissions: Energy use vs. other contributors (INDC compliant)). Emissions of C О₂ represented the bulk of Kazakhstan's overall GHG emissions in 2020 (82%), r e\u0000ecting signi\u0000cant dependence on coal combustion in overall energy use, while emissions of methane (CH ₄), nitrous oxide (N ₂O), hydro \u0000uorocarbons (HFCs), per \u0000uorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexa\u0000uoride (SF ₆) collectively amount to around 18% of Kazakhstan's annual GHG emissions (see Figure 4.14 Kazakhstan's GHG emissions by type, 2016–20). Examination of GHG emissions by source shows that the energy sector is the main contributor to total emissions in Kazakhstan. In fact, energy activities account for 77% (excluding LULUCF) of all GHG emissions in 2021 (see Figure 4.15 Kazakhstan's historical GHG emissions by sector). This is primarily due to the use of fossil fuels, particularly coal, in power generation. In Kazakhstan, the electric power sector alone accounts for nearly half of total estimated GHG emissions (46.4% in 2022), as around 70% of the electricity generated in the country is produced by coal-\u0000red power plants. In 2021, agriculture accounted for 13% of total GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF). This is mainly caused by internal fermentation of farm animals, which releases methane, and the cultivation of soils, which emits nitrogen oxide. ⁵⁴ Methane emissions account for 24.3 MMtCO ₂e or 57% of all emissions in the agricultural sector, while nitrogen oxide accounts for 18.5 MMtCO ₂e or 43%. GHG emissions from agriculture have been increasing, rising from 30.8 MMtCO ₂e in 2013 to 42.8 MMtCO ₂e in 2021, due to the growing number of animals and amount of farmed acreage. ⁵⁵ Industry contributed 8% or 27.1 MMtCO ₂e to GHG emissions in Kazakhstan. This sector releases gases such as CO ₂ and CH ₄, as well as PFCs, HFCs, and SF ₆, which are only emitted by this sector. Metallurgy, which is a larger producer of pig iron, steel, iron ore, ferroalloys, and copper, is the largest contributor to industry emissions, accounting for 55.5% of emissions. The production of construction materials (cement, lime, gypsum, and bricks) is also a signi\u0000cant source of emissions, accounting for 32% of the industrial sector emissions. Waste and LULUCF contribute 2% and 1%, respectively, to total GHG emissions. In the past two decades, GHG emissions from waste have risen by 78%, due to an increase in the amount of solid household waste produced and the country's growing population. Kazakhstan's LULUCF sector emits more GHG than it absorbs, mainly because of the cultivation of land, which results in higher emissions than forested areas can absorb. The power sector in Kazakhstan is responsible for the majority of GHG emissions. Coal-\u0000red power plants, which are a major contributor to the country's electricity production, are the primary source of these emissions (see Figure 4.16 Base-case outlook for GHG emissions from energy use in Kazakhstan).

KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 103 achieve a notable reduction in GHG emissions nationwide, the energy sector must decarbonize. Or more precisely, reducing coal use in electric power generation is the key to decarbonization for Kazakhstan. Without meaningful progress here, all the other decarbonization strategies in the Low-Carbon Development Strategy will be insuﬃcient to bring down emissions meaningfully. But there is a limit to how far Kazakhstan can realistically shift away from coal in power generation, particularly in light of energy security considerations. Still, Kazakhstan should make every eﬀort to achieve meaningful reductions in coal use. Power sector decarbonization will necessitate a gradual shift away from coal-based electricity generation toward cleaner energy sources, such as renewables and natural gas. ► Development of renewable energy sources is crucial in reducing GHG emissions in the energy sector. Kazakhstan's government has played a signi\u0000cant role in promoting this initiative, leading to a noticeable increase in the use of renewable energy and achieving a 4.5% share of renewable energy in the country's electricity supply. These eﬀorts contribute to diversifying the country's energy portfolio and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. However, it is important to consider the challenges of maintaining stability and balance in the electricity grid. Renewable sources, such as solar and wind energy, are intermittent, subject to \u0000uctuations Figure 4. 15 Kazakhstan's historical GHG emissions by sector (MMtCO e) ₂ Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights, UNFCCC. © 2023 S&P Global.-203080130180230280330380430 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020Energy Industry Agriculture Waste LULUCF 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014 2018 2022 2026 2030 2034 2038 2042 2046 2050 Coal Oil / petroleum products Natural gas Other (peat, wood, etc.) 050100150200250300350Figure 4. 16 Base-case outlook for GHG emissions from energy use in Kazakhstan (MMtCO e) ₂ Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global.KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 104 depending on the weather conditions. This can cause electricity production to vary, which aﬀects the reliability and stability of the power system. Therefore, the development of maneuverable capacities, such as \u0000exible generation (ga s-\u0000red power plants) and storage systems (batteries), are essential to ensure the stability of the energy system, particularly during periods of peak demand. A comprehensive approach is necessary for the development of renewable energy, which includes not only increasing the share of renewable energy but also creating a supportive structure of maneuverable capacities. ► Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies can be a valuable tool in combatting GHG emissions. Governments will need to consider the cost of these technologies when deciding how to proceed. CCUS involves the capture, transport, and utilization of carbon, and its storage in deep geological formations. This can reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Kazakhstan has relied heavily on coal as an energy source due to its abundance in the country, particularly in the north. This has enabled reliable and low-cost electricity for the economy, so moving away from coal will not be easy. Further, CCUS implementation faces challenges such as technical complexity, high infrastructure costs, and ensuring carbon storage safety. Despite these challenges, CCUS presents an alternative way to reduce emissions without completely ending fossil fuel use. ► Reducing GHG emissions can be achieved by energy- eﬃcient technologies and projects that improve fuel combustion eﬃciency. This can lead to a reduction in resource consumption and the amount of carbon emissions released into the atmosphere. Sectors across the economy can bene\u0000t from energy-eﬃcient technologies. Upgrading equipment, reducing energy losses during transmission, and eﬀective management and monitoring of systems are all ways to conserve energy. By reducing energy consumption, GHG emissions can be reduced as well. Improving combustion technologies for burning fossil fuels is another strategy to consider. This can lead to greater energy realization from the fuel. These projects, in addition to reducing GHG emissions, can also lower operating costs and increase competitiveness. ► Managing methane leaks in the energy sector is a key challenge in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It means implementing comprehensive measures and innovative technologies to prevent, detect, and repair leaks throughout all stages of oil and gas production, transportation, and re\u0000ning. T o minimize leaks during production, drilling and well operation technologies should be improved. The use of modern monitoring and control systems, such as sensors, can facilitate the quick detection of small leaks and enable their prompt elimination. In the transportation of oil and gas, infrastructure such as pipelines, compressor stations, and storage facilities should be a focus of attention. T o prevent methane leaks into the environment, pipeline modernization projects, regular inspection for cracks and corrosion, and the use of monitoring systems are needed. 4.6 State Support for Decarbonization Government support for reducing carbon emissions is crucial for achieving climate targets and transitioning to more sustainable development. Amid growing concern about climate change, many countries recognize the importance of decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and switching to renewable energy sources. T o achieve this goal, governments are developing and implementing various support measures that incentivize companies and investors to participate in decarbonizing the economy. Thinking about how to incentivize clean-energy investment is important, especially to the extent that the private sector (including foreign investors) will be asked to provide a lot of the up-front capital. Investors need to be con\u0000dent that initial costs will be recouped over a reasonable period of time. Reliance only on \"sticks\" (regulations), without any clear path that investors see for returns, will drive away investment. So, it is important for the government to have a plan for how to support clean-energy investment. The \u0000rst step in governmental support is to create and execute national decarbonization strategies and plans. T o reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Kazakhstan has adopted a Strategy of Low-Carbon Development by 2060. The Strategy outlines national"}

One of the three key areas of the Strategy is the decarbonization of industries and processes related to fossil fuels. To reduce emissions, the Strategy suggests measures like transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, improving energy eﬃciency and conservation, and elec tri\u0000cation — replacing fuel-burning installations with electricity-based technologies. The next step of state support is the creation of functional regulatory frameworks and legislation that contribute to the decarbonization of the economy. The government can establish regulations for energy eﬃciency, greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon trading. These regulations can encourage companies and industries to make appropriate changes and search for innovative solutions. To support the growth of renewable energy, several legislative initiatives have been developed, including tax incentives and other \u0000nancial bene\u0000ts. In 2021, Kazakhstan introduced an updated Environmental Code that requires polluters to use the best available technologies in their operations. In addition, Kazakhstan has also launched a system for trading greenhouse gas emissions quotas. T o decarbonize the economy and meet climate targets, the state must implement tangible support measures that complement the adoption of legislative acts. While legislation is crucial, the eﬀective execution of spec i\u0000c actions is essential for successful transformation and the reduction of GHG emissions. In order to drive the adoption of cleaner technologies, it is essential to provide \u0000nancial assistance for their development and implementation. This can be achieved by oﬀering state-KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 105 provided subsidies, or loans with favorable terms, or speci\u0000c kinds of tax relief to companies that are implementing eco-friendly solutions. These measures help to mitigate \u0000nancial risks and foster innovative ideas in the energy sector. In Kazakhstan's application of BAT principles as outlined in the Environmental Code, the state's proposal to merely waive environmental fees probably is not suﬃcient to cover the costs associated with implementing expensive low-carbon technologies. These environmental fees only make up approximately 2% of a company's operational expenses. ⁵⁶ This is clearly insuﬃcient for successful and sustainable integration of best-available low-carbon technologies. More \u0000nancial support is needed for their successful implementation. 4.7 Initiatives in Low-Carbon Development Despite the active promotion of a low-carbon policy, there are not many real initiatives in this \u0000eld in Kazakhstan. The largest initiative to date is the project for the production of \"green hydrogen\" in Mangystau Oblast. Among the companies in the energy sector, KMG is among the leaders in activity. 4.7.1 Hydrogen In 2022 Kazakhstan created the \u0000rst alliance on hydrogen called \"Green Hydrogen\" in Kazakhstan at the Astana Finance Days- 2022 conference. A year later, in February 2023, Kazakhstan approved the Low-Carbon Development Strategy of Kazakhstan to 2060. In this strategy, hydrogen is assigned a signi\u0000cant role in transforming energy use in transportation and industry, two sectors that are diﬃcult to decarbonize. For example, hydrogen is supposed to be used in those modes of transport that are diﬃcult or impossible to fully electrify, such as water and air transport. 4.7.1.1 \"Green\" hydrogen production in Mangystau Oblast In October 2022, the Kazakh government signed an investment agreement with the European renewable energy group Svevind Energy GmbH for the construction of a hydrogen production project in Mangystau Oblast that would rank as one of the \u0000ve largest projects in the world. ⁵⁷ The project will use wind and photovoltaic generation with a total capacity of up to 40 GW, generating approximately 120 billion kWh of renewable electricity annually. ⁵⁸ The electricity will supply an industrial park with a capacity of 20 GW of hydrogen electrolysis, located near the Kuryk port on the Caspian Sea coast. The Caspian Sea will be the source of water for hydrogen electrolysis, following desalinization. The project is said to include the construction and operation of a desalination plant with a capacity of 255,000 m ³ of seawater per day (93.075 million m ³ per year). But questions surrounding water availability are of paramount importance to Kazakhstan, and the project, and could very well emerge as one of the major obstacles preventing project execution. Freshwater availability has long been a major problem in Mangystau Oblast. Besides several local desalination plants (e.g., in Aktau, Kalamkas), one of its key sources of fresh water is water piped all the way from the Volga River delta in Russia, a distance of nearly 2,000 km. R e\u0000ecting its economic and social importance, the pipeline has been the target of an ongoing refurbishment and modernization program in the last few years to increase its throughput capacity to over 30 million m ³ per year. In 2023, for example, authorities intend to augment fresh water supply with completion of an 18 km water pipeline and water pumping station, \u0000nanced by a 2.12 billion tenge ($4.7 million) investment by Freedom Holding Corp. ⁵⁹ Despite this, authorities in Mangystau Oblast still anticipate the region's water de\u0000cit will reach 110,000 m ³ per day by 2025. Hyrasia One, a subsidiary of Svevind Energy Group, indicates that no \u0000nal decision has been made on speci\u0000c markets for the hydrogen and therefore export destinations and routes. Svevind believes the hydrogen can \u0000nd a ready market in Europe or alternatively can be used within Kazakhstan itself to manufacture \"green\" steel or aluminum. Clearly though, Europe ranks high on the list of potential markets given ambitious plans for hydrogen development there and the expectation that Europe will account for about 11% of global hydrogen demand by 2030 and 20% by 2040; furthermore, a signi\u0000cant share of demand is expected to be met with imports. ⁶⁰ As noted by Svevind, Hyrasia One could become \"a supporting pillar for the hydrogen markets currently emerging in Europe, as well as in Kazakhstan itself and in Asian countries.\" potentially be r econ\u0000gured to carry hydrogen cross Russia \u0000rst. Transport by rail is technically feasible but would be far more expensive than these other options. Importing the"}

Hydrogen is not a very transportable product, owing to the relatively high costs involved for transportation within the overall value chain, and this remains true even if hydrogen is transformed into \"green\" ammonia for long-distance transportation. ⁶² Logistically, western Kazakhstan fairly remote from Europe and lacks direct access to international sea lanes for transport by ship; furthermore, the only existing gas pipelines from the region that could 4.7.1.2 KMG and other hydrogen initiatives In 2022, KMG created a new structural unit, the Competence Center for Hydrogen Energy, which is intended to serve as a research hub. The company has designated hydrogen as one of its low-carbon initiatives, establishing the pilot project \"Hydrogen Mobility\" that will feature the construction of a hydrogen \u0000lling station at the Atyrau r e\u0000nery. ⁶³ Hydrogen Mobility is not the \u0000rst KMG initiative in this area. Previously, in 2021, KMG announced its participation in blue hydrogen and blue ammonia projects using natural gas as feedstock in cooperation with the German-based industrial gas and engineering company Linde. The project was subsequently cancelled due to its large water requirements and other technical issues. The Pavlodar r e\u0000nery and Air Liquide Munay T ech Gases LLP (ALMTG) also signed an agreement for the construction of a hydrogen production unit for the production of winter diesel fuel (160,000 tons per year) at an estimated cost of 80 million euros. ⁶⁴ Since 2018, ALMTG has been successfully operating hydrogen and nitrogen production units at the Pavlodar petrochemical plant, and from 2021 at the Atyrau r e\u0000nery. ⁶⁵ And in May 2023 ALMTG signed an agreement with KunT ech LLP to provide its production facilities in Kazakhstan with renewable energy. ⁶⁶ The agreement seeks to cover 100% of the electricity consumption at ALMTG production sites, reducing indirect CO ₂ emissions by 33% in 2035 compared to 2020, and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Several other initiatives have been launched on green hydrogen in Kazakhstan over the past couple of years, but have not really moved forward: ► On Astana Finance Days-2022, Green Spark Limited LLP and GRAF Industries S.p.A. signed an agreement on the development of a technology for the \u0000rst hydrogen \u0000lling stations in the territory of Kazakhstan, but the initiative was not further developed. ► First Kazakhstan commissioned a pilot project for the production of green hydrogen in the West Kazakhstan Oblast. The project includes solar panels that power electrolyzers that split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Project development by GreenSpark was launched in 2021, but is still not completed. 4.7.2 CCS/CCUS projects One of the directions of KMG's Low-Carbon Development Program for 2022-31 is a project to introduce carbon capture and storage technologies. An important step in this direction was the signing in June 2022 of a memorandum of understanding between KMG and Chevron (through its subsidiary Chevron Munaigas Inc.) to explore potential carbon reduction projects in Kazakhstan, with a particular focus on CCUS. A similar agreement on the joint study of CCUS projects was signed in September 2021 between KMG and Shell Kazakhstan b.v. In the Low-Carbon Development Concept of Samruk-Kazyna (KMG's parent company), the implementation of the CCUS at KMG is envisaged in several stages: ► Stage 1 (2022-23): Screening of C О₂ emission sources and injection reservoirs at KMG assets ► Stage 2 (2024-25): Design for the \u0000rst stage of a CCS/CCUS pilot project at KMG assets ► Stage 3 (2026-28): Implementation of a pilot project on the use of CCS/CCUS technology. ⁶⁷ And at the end of 2021, KPO announced the establishment “Project 365,\" which includes the \"green transformation\" of the Karachaganak \u0000eld. The company expects to develop a clear strategy to achieve carbon neutrality at the \u0000eld, de\u0000ning the intermediate stages to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The \u0000rst studies on CO₂ capture and storage were launched in 2021. ⁶⁸ 4.7.3 Electric vehicles Over the past several years, Kazakhstan's imports of electric vehicles have risen sharply, particularly from China (see Figure 4.17 Number of electric cars imported by Kazakhstan).

As of 1 June 2023, there were a total of 3,590 electric vehicles in the country, including 3,229 passenger cars, 226 cargo vehicles, and 135 buses. There are only 203 electric car charging stations in the country, with the most located in Almaty (116 stations) and Astana (79 stations). Other major cities either may have no charging stations at all or 1-2 stations at best (see Figure 4.19 Number of charging stations for electric vehicles in Kazakhstan by city). There are two companies in Kazakhstan that specialize in the installation and operation of electric charging stations, EZS Operator LLP and eDrive.kz. Tariﬀs at eDrive.kz stations vary from 40 tenge to 70 tenge/kW at slow AC stations, and from 50 tenge to 80 tenge/kW at fast stations (depending on the capacity of the station). In Kazakhstan there is no legal framework regulating tariﬀs at charging stations for electric vehicles. Kazakhstan is actively promoting domestic production of electric cars. Production of electric cars is currently planned to begin in 2035. The following projects have already been announced: ► A multi-brand plant with a full workshop for the production of Chinese cars. In September 2022, Astana Motors signed memorandums with automobile concerns Chery Automobile Company, Changan International Corporation, and Great Wall Motor to produce these Chinese brand cars (Chery, Changan, and Haval) in Almaty city. The start of construction is scheduled for 2025 with a production capacity of 90,000 vehicles per year, of which 60% is planned for export to neighboring CIS countries. The preliminary cost of the project is estimated at $200 million. ► During 2020-21, in cooperation with China-based company Yutong Hongkong Limited CN.China, assembly lines for Yutong buses and specialized equipment at the QazT ehna LLP plant were installed in Karaganda Oblast.

In early 2019, Hyundai Trans Auto became an oﬃcial distributor for the production and sale of Golden Dragon buses in Kazakhstan after signing an agreement with Chinese bus manufacturer Xiamen Golden Dragon Bus Co., Ltd. ⁷⁰ ► Start-up Qoshcar Automotive announced plans to create an electric or hybrid car engine, and to produce 4,000 cars annually; it also intends to manufacture its own vehicle charging stations. Development and construction of the \u0000rst prototype is estimated at $2 million. Although the Qoshcar Automotive project started in April 2022, as of March 2023 company was still searching for an investor. 4.7.3.1 Policy support In 2022, the Mazhilis (Kazakhstan's lower parliament) initiated a draft law on the promotion of environmentally friendly transport and the development of infrastructure for electric cars. The bill provides for free parking spaces in paid parking lots, creation of designated places for charging electric vehicles, and the allocation of a special green registration numbers. ⁷¹ According to the Committee of State Revenues of Kazakhstan, imports of electric vehicles from countries that are not members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) are exempt from paying duties and value added tax. This applies to import quotas of 10,000 EVs for 2022 and 15,000 for 2023 assigned by the Eurasian Economic Commission. Also, there are no recycling fees from 4 June 2021 for electric cars. ⁷²4.7.4 Biofuels The production and use of biofuels is not widespread in Kazakhstan.

KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 109 4.8 Update on Environmental Code Provisions for BAT in Industry The 2021 Environmental Code introduced a number of important initiatives aimed at reducing and mitigating the environmental impact of economic activities, particularly the operations of large industrial enterprises. Currently eﬀorts are underway to prepare domestic operators for a shift to Best Available T echniques (BAT) principles. The Code mandates that by 2025, the top 50 enterprises responsible for 80% of emissions must obtain Integrated Environmental Permits based on BAT principles. Failure to comply will result in an increase in environmental payments. The current lack of incentives for the shift from the state makes it challenging to encourage the modernization of production processes. The Environmental Code as well as the introduction of BAT principles and their implications were covered in detail in The National Energy Report 2021. This section provides an update. ⁷⁵ According to the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, an integrated technological audit was conducted at 94 enterprises in key industries as part of the transition towards the BAT principles by the end of the August 2023. Additionally, 83 industry reports were generated. For the 50 largest emitters during 2021-23, 16 industr y-speci\u0000c BAT reference books were developed. There are plans to develop 14 more BAT reference books during 2024-27. ⁷⁶ Transitioning to BAT, especially in the power sector, faces various \u0000nancial, technological, logistical, and organizational challenges that require a comprehensive approach. Particularly challenging is the fact that many power plants still operate using outdated technologies that have exceeded their life expectancy. The Minister of Energy, Almasadam Satkaliyev, reported that a technical audit of 57 stations revealed that 62% of power boilers and 58% of turbines have exceeded their lifespan and require immediate replacement. A total of 2.5 GW of capacity also needs to be replaced. ⁷⁷ Therefore, among the \u0000rst to be developed was the BAT handbook for \"Fuel Combustion at Large Installations for Energy Production,\" which along with the BAT handbook for \"Energy Eﬃciency in the Implementation of Economic and (or) Other Activities\" has been preliminarily assessed by the International Green Technologies and Investment Projects Center (IGTIC) to signi\u0000cantly reduce pollutant emissions (see Table 4.3 Projected impact of BAT implementation by industry). As Kazakhstan prepares to adopt BAT principles, experts have determined that many of the parameters set by the EU are currently unattainable by Kazakhstan. Therefore, transitional measures have been proposed to extend implementation times and soften some technological indicators. While emission standards in reference books often align with those in the EU, some concessions may still be necessary based on unique industry characteristics. For instance, the BAT handbook for \"Fuel Combustion at Large Installations for Energy Production\" proposes a more gradual move towards established standards starting with particulate matter emissions and only later addressing gaseous emissions. A diﬀerentiated approach to setting the maximum permissible emissions for new and existing production facilities may be sensible, recognizing that production technologies tend to 13 56 60 4,200 35 12,682 70 65 55 75 80 77 Reduction in fuel consumption - 40% 78 60 907,225 Oil and gas r e\u0000ning and processing Oil and gas upstream production Inorganic chemicals production Cement and lime production Lead production (mining, smelting, and processing) Copper and precious metals (including gold) production Zinс and cadmium production Non-ferrous metal ores (including precious metals) production and processing Iron ore (including other ferrous ores) production and processing Ferroalloys production Energy eﬃciency in economic and/or other activities Fuel combustion at large installations for energy production Total75,000 109,320 Chemical CementOil and gas Mining and metallurgy Energy 706,023 Table 4.3 Projected impact of BAT implementation by industry Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights, IGTIC. © 2023 S&P Global. 74 The Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated 15 November 2010 No. 351-IV. 75 See Section 2.6.1 and 2.6.2 in The National Energy Report 2021 . 76 See the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources' report, outlining the activities for the year 2022; https://primeminister.kz/ru/news/reviews/v- minekologii-podveli-itogi-raboty-za-2022-god-1203351. 77 https://primeminister.kz/ru/news/povyshenie-tarifov-na-kommunalnye-uslugi- budet-poetapnym-alibek-kuantyrov-24742.KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS Emissions reduction (%) Total reduction (t/y) BAT reference book title Industry 110 1,678 962 240 20 20 15 20 20 20 100 20 100 02004006008001,0001,2001,4001,6001,800 Pulverizing, sizing and sorting, transportation, and storageConcentrate drying Pellet \u0000ringActual data BREFDraft of the BAT reference book for new and reconstructed production facilities Draft of"}

New production facilities can take advantage of modern equipment and processes that help reduce emissions of pollutants and improve the level of control over production processes. Moreover, the \u0000eld of environmental protection is continually evolving, leading to regular updates and tightening of environmental standards, which are considered when updating BAT reference books every eight years. T o minimize negative impacts on the environment and public health, new production facilities must comply with stricter regulations. It is worth noting that implementing stricter regulations for new productions does not exempt existing enterprises from following enhanced measures to reduce their environmental impact. Renovating and modernizing current production facilities are equally crucial steps towards reducing pollution and complying with environmental requirements. KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 111 4.9 High-Level Takeaways Government support for reducing carbon emissions is crucial for achieving climate targets and transitioning to more sustainable development. T o achieve these goals, Kazakhstan must develop and implement various support measures that incentivize companies and investors to participate in decarbonizing the economy. Reliance only on \"sticks\" (regulations), without any clear path that investors see for returns, will drive away investment. T o eﬀectively decarbonize its economy, a primary focus should be on decarbonizing the power sector. With nearly 70% of electricity generated from outdated coal-\u0000red plants, a strategic shift away from coal reliance towards gas and non-fossil fuel sources will produce a signi\u0000cant carbon emissions reduction. However, the pace of the shift needs to be judicious and careful for energy security reasons. This undertaking would also create a foundation for sustainable energy transformation as the country's economy becomes more elec tri\u0000ed. Kazakhstan's substantial support for renewable energy development is commendable and played a pivotal role in driving its rapid deployment. Going forward it is also important for the government to extend its attention to other critical initiatives to mitigate carbon emissions (particularly the ETS) and maintain a balance between environmental and energy security priorities. Kazakhstan's ETS oﬀers great potential to reduce the country's GHG emissions. As demonstrated through the experience of the EU, r e\u0000ning and \u0000netuning the operations of ETS requires some time. In Kazakhstan, the current ETS system still needs operational improvements and a better mechanism for carbon pricing. T o incentivize greener solutions the following adjustments to the ETS appear warranted: ► Expanding the scope of sectors covered and including other types of emissions. This would increase the overall eﬀectiveness of the emissions trading system in Kazakhstan. Currently, Kazakhstan's ETS focuses solely on C О₂ emissions from relatively few sectors. T o incorporate more emitters and drive a fairer distribution of responsibility for emissions across the economy, there are plans to expand the ETS to include other industries and GHGs. ► Progressively reduce annual emission caps (allowances). Prior to 2022, these had been increasing over time, but with the transition to the \u0000fth phase of operation (2022–25), allowances are now decreasing owing to the implementation of a linear reduction factor of 1.5%. T o ensure Kazakhstan meets its unconditional commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement, it may be necessary to further raise this reduction factor. This could be particularly important if the sectors that are currently outside the system (“unregulated”) remain that way in the future. ► Introduce an auction for the distribution of initial allowances. This is a useful method to increase transparency and eﬃciency in carbon reductions and allocations and greatly helps in establishing a price for carbon. As of yet, no auctions have been conducted on Kazakhstan's ETS. It is crucial to initiate the allocation of at least some portion of initial allowances through auctions. However, auctions should be introduced gradually, taking into account the economic realities of Kazakhstan's entities. ► Other measures are needed to bolster the ETS. Zhasyl Damu must take a number of decisive actions by implementing several additional measures. This could involve introduction of a robust market stability reserve, developing more eﬃcient benchmarks, and the enhancement of the underlying monitoring, reporting and v eri\u0000cation system to drive improved performance. In adopting BAT principles, borrowing from EU practice, it is important to recognize that many of the parameters set by the EU for BAT are currently unattainable by Kazakhstan; therefore, localized transitional measures are needed that r e\u0000ect this reality, such as extending implementation times and softening some technological indicators. Similarly, a diﬀerentiated approach to setting the maximum permissible emissions for new and existing production facilities may be sensible. KAZAKHSTAN'S INITIATIVES REGARDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 112 KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR 5. KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR 5.1 Key Points ► The oil industry has recovered from the bulk of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but fallout from the sharp escalation of armed con\u0000ict in Ukraine from February 2022 has brought myriad new challenges. Still, most trends in Kazakhstan's oil balance still remain generally positive, with another year of robust domestic product demand. In our base-case outlook, oil production and exports both reach a maximum fairly soon—in the mid-2020s—and then slowly decline during the remainder of the outlook period to 2050. In contrast, r e\u0000nery throughput remains on an"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_NationalReport23_en_80", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\NationalReport23_en.pdf", "text": "upward slope, r e\u0000ecting relatively strong continued domestic product demand growth. Speci\u0000cally, our outlook during 2023-50 is for oil production to fall to 72.1 MMt (1.44 million b/d) and for net oil exports to contract by about 26% to 48.3 MMt (966,000 b/d), while r e\u0000nery throughput rises by 24% to 22.3 MMt (446,000 b/d). ► Kazakhstan's oil production pro \u0000le mainly re \u0000ects the trajectories of the “Big 3” \u0000elds—Tengiz, Kashagan, and Karachaganak—being developed by IOC-led consortia. Kazakhstan's oﬃcial OPEC+ program currently envisages limits on national oil output through at least the end of 2024. These three \u0000elds contributed 63.1% of national oil output in 2022, and their share is expected to grow to a maximum of 71.0% in 2029 before contracting to about 60% of the total in 2050. In short, the mega projects' growth or decline rates and interruptions due to maintenance programs or other issues typically have more impact on the national production pr o\u0000le than the country's voluntary OPEC+ production quotas. The main driver of the national production trend in the early 2020s is the T engiz Future Growth Project, which is scheduled to ramp up during 2024-25, while an expected second phase of Kashagan will subsequently partially oﬀset ongoing decline at older \u0000elds. ► Full realization of Kazakhstan's oil production potential ultimately depends on attraction of investment in new upstream projects through further improvements to the regulatory and \u0000scal regime. Positive recent developments include adoption of Improved Model Contract (IMC) legislation oﬀering tax and other incentives for complex projects, but the IMC suﬀers from some of the same limitations of the typical (existing) model contracts, including a lack of clarity and transparency concerning local content rules. One signpost of investor reluctance to undertake new upstream projects without further amelioration of above- ground conditions is the limited success in new upstream bidding rounds within the framework of the online (electronic) process for auctioning E&P blocks (e.g., cancellations, insuﬃcient number of participants, and the lack of participation by IOCs). Current \u0000scal terms for mature \u0000elds in Kazakhstan also appear inadequate for full implementation of redevelopment plans by the national oil company KazMunayGaz (KMG) to signi\u0000cantly slow or reverse decline rates at legacy \u0000elds. ► Kazakhstan has intensi\u0000ed eﬀorts to diversify its crude oil export routes since February 2022, with an initial focus on trans- Caspian outlets to bypass Russian territory—re \u0000ecting heightened concerns about Russian transit risk. This includes concerns over the reliability of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline route, which handled 82.1% of Kazakh oil exports in 2022 (and more than 95% of Kazakh oil exports transited Russia). Kazakh authorities have tasked KMG to diversify export \u0000ows by boosting trans-Caspian volumes in particular, and this has meant the resumption of regular shipments via the Baku-Tbilisi- Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline. But infrastructure constraints and high transportation costs impede a very large-scale ramp-up of such volumes. In the S&P Global base case, Kazakhstan's trans-Caspian shipments longer term remain in a range of 5-10% of total Kazakh oil exports, in contrast to an aspirational government target equating to over a quarter of Kazakh export volumes. ► Downstream, Kazakh r e\u0000nery output of all the primary products increased for the second year in a row in 2022. Diesel fuel is the single largest component (product) in Kazakhstan's re\u0000nery slate and in its domestic consumption balance, and diesel is expected to retain this leading role over the outlook period; altogether, diesel output surges by nearly 90% to 10.3 MMt by 2050, driven by a 126% jump in domestic diesel demand, mainly from trucking, to 12.3 MMt. After diesel, gasoline production is expected to register the strongest growth during 2023-50 on the back of increasing private car ownership (and relatively limited expansion of alternatives to gasoline -\u0000red vehicles through 2050), while kerosene output also increases robustly in response to demand growth in the aviation segment. The base case is for an overall rise of Kazakhstan's domestic apparent consumption of all products by 43.0% to 22.8 MMt in 2050. However, our outlook for domestic product consumption is contingent on liberalization of domestic crude and r e\u0000ned product prices, whereby these prices reach export netback parity levels by around 2030. If prices are kept ar ti\u0000cially low, in contrast, domestic product demand will be greater than in our current base case. ► Our outlook envisions signi\u0000cant expansion of the Shymkent re\u0000nery, located in southern Kazakhstan, where product consumption growth is highest. The S&P Global base case assumes that a 50% increase in Shymkent capacity is suﬃcient to meet the expected increase in domestic product demand, in conjunction with limited product imports, but through market competition consistent with EAEU integration rather than ad hoc administrative measures such as temporary product trade bans and other controls. 5.2 Overview of Oil Balance Dynamics and Industry Ownership Structure This section summarizes key changes in Kazakhstan's oil balance during 2021-22 and our outlook for 2023-50 dynamics. It then provides an overview of the geographical distribution of major oil sector assets as well as the industry ownership structure.¹ 1 For additional background, see The National Energy Report 2021, Chapter 3. 114 Table 5.1 Crude oil/condensate balance for Kazakhstan (MМt) 2015 2020 2021 2022 2016 2017 2018 2019Percent change 2021-22 79.5 64.8 61.6 3.1 2.8 0.3 -- 0.0 -- 0.1 7.0 0.1 64.7 14.7 14.5 4.8 4.5 4.9 0.4 0.378.0 63.4 61.6 1.7 0.8 0.6 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 7.0 0.0 63.4 14.7 14.5 4.6 4.5 4.8 0.6 0.286.2 69.6 69.2 0.4 0.1 0.0 0.1 0.0 0.2 0.1 0.0 10.1 0.0 69.5 16.7 14.9 4.7 4.7 4.7 0.7 1.890.4 70.2 69.4 0.8 0.5 0.0 0.1 0.0 0.2 0.0 0.0 10.0 0.0 70.2 20.2 16.4 5.3 4.7 5.3 1.1 3.890.6 70.0 69.8 0.2 0.1 -- -- -- 0.1 0.0 0.0 10.0 0.0 70.0 20.6 17.0 5.3 5.4 5.4 1.0 3.685.7 70.6 70.0 0.5 0.1 -- -- 0.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 10.0 0.0 70.6 15.1 15.8 5.0 4.8 5.0 1.0 -0.785.9 65.7 65.6 0.1 0.1 -- -- -- 0.1 -- 0.0"}

The recovery of Kazakhstan's oil industry from the negative impacts of COVID-19 remains uneven, and in 2022 oil produc- tion, exports, and apparent domestic consumption still remained below the pre-pandemic level (see Table 5.1 Crude oil/condensate balance for Kazakhstan). In 2022, national oil production fell by 1.9% to 84.2 MMt (1.77 million b/d), oil exports declined by 0.8% to 65.2 MMt (1.30 million b/d), and apparent crude oil consump- tion contracted by 5.7% to 19.0 MMt (0.38 million b/d), even as re\u0000nery throughput rose by 5.2% to 17.9 MMt (0.36 million b/d). Key 2023 signposts so far indicate that Kazakh oil production, exports, and domestic r e\u0000ned product demand will all increase on an annual basis this year—reversing the 2022 decline trend—while r e\u0000nery throughput remains somewhat sluggish. The S&P Global base case is for Kazakh oil production to continue growing in both 2024 and 2025, after which a slow but steady decline sets in, leaving national liquids output roughly 14% lower in 2050 than in 2022. The bulk of oil output continues to be directed to export markets, but net export volumes contract (along with aggregate oil production) longer term, falling by 26% during the outlook period alongside a 25.0% increase in domestic apparent oil demand. As a result, the share of total production directed to export markets declines from 77.4% in 2022 to about 67% in 2050 (see Figure 5.1 Kazakhstan's crude oil/condensate balance: Outlook to 2050). Roughly 95% of the country's oil/condensate reserves are located in western Kazakhstan in three petroleum basins: Precaspian, Mangyshlak, and North Ustyurt. Kazakhstan's main oil-producing area is in the northwestern portion of the country: the two largest producing \u0000elds, T engiz and Kashagan, are both located in Atyrau Oblast (province) (although Kashagan is about 80 km oﬀshore in the Caspian Sea), while the third largest \u0000eld, Karachaganak, is in West Kazakhstan Oblast near the Russian border. These “Big 3” \u0000elds accounted between them for 63.1% of national output in 2022.KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR 115 Source: S&P Global Commodity Insight s. © 2023 S&P Global.

KMG has signi\u0000cant minority stakes in each of the “Big 3” projects, but most of KMG's equity oil output comes from fully-owned subsidiaries producing mainly from mature onshore \u0000elds. KMG's KazTransOil (KTO) subsidiary handles much of Kazakhstan's crude oil transportation. KMG also controls the Pavlodar and Atyrau r e\u0000neries, and has a 49.72% stake in the Shymkent plant, whose majority owner is the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). In 2022, KMG accounted for an estimated 26% of national oil production, 53% of oil transportation in Kazakhstan (including both trunk pipelines and sea transportation), and 84% of oil r e\u0000ning in the country (see Table 5.2 KMG oil industry assets and 2022 operating results).⁵Smaller \u0000elds in western Kazakhstan and elsewhere export some of their output but also supply the country's r e\u0000neries with crude feedstock. Kazakhstan contains three large oil r e\u0000neries and 19 mini r e\u0000neries spread across the country. The three major plants—Atyrau, Pavlodar, and Shymkent—accounted for 94.4% of national re \u0000nery throughput in 2022, and are located, respectively, in the northwest (Atyrau Oblast), northeast (Pavlodar Oblast), and south (South Kazakhstan Oblast). (See Figure 5.2 Kazakhstan's oil sector (selected key elements).) The corporate structure of the Kazakh oil industry varies widely by segment; i.e., upstream, midstream, or downstream. The upstream oil production pr o\u0000le and export stream is dominated by the IOC-led consortia developing Tengiz (Tengizchevroil [TCO]²), Kashagan (North Caspian Operating Company [NCOC]³), and Karachaganak (Karachaganak Petroleum KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR 4 The KPO shareholders are Shell and Eni (each with 29.25%), Chevron (18%), Lukoil (13.5%) and KMG (10%). 5 KMG Annual Report 2022, p. 38, https://www.kmg.kz/en/investors/reporting/ .2 The TCO partners are Chevron (50%), ExxonMobil Kazakhstan (25%), KMG (20%) and Lukoil (5%). 3 NCOC is comprised of KMG (16.88%), Shell, TotalEnergies, Eni and ExxonMobil (each with 16.81%), CNPC (8.33%) and Inpex (7.56%). 116 Figure 5.2 Kazakhstan's oil sector (selected key elements ) Upstream Midstream Downstream 100 100 50 50 50 33 50 100 1005.1 2.6 3.0 0.7 1.1 0.6 0.3 0.4 0.04 20 17 105.8 1.4 1.0KMG stake, %2022 production , MMt (KMG share) Producer Operating assets OzenMunayGaz Embamunaigas Mangistaumunaigaz Kazgermunai Karazhanbasmunai PetroKazakhstan Kazakhoil Aktobe Kazakhturkmunay Urikhtau Operating Mega projects T engizchevroil KMG Kashagan KMG Karachaganak 90 50 51 21 10040.7 9.6 2.9 12.2 0.6KMG stake, %2022 transportation, MMt (KMG share) Asset Pipeline KTO KCP MunayTas CPC Marine \u0000eet Kazmor trans\u0000ot Caspian Sea 100 100 50 505.2 5.5 3.1 0.5KMG stake, %2022 throughput, MMt (KMG share) Re\u0000nery Major plants Atyrau Pavlodar PKOP Mini-r e\u0000neries Caspi Bitum Table 5.2 KMG oil industry assets and 2022 operating results (key examples) Notes: KTO = KazTransOil, KCP = Kazakhstan-China Pipeline, CPC = Caspian Pipeline Consortium, PKOP = PetroKazakhstan Oil Products (Shymkent r e\u0000nery).

As of 1 January 2023, Kazakhstan's oﬃcially reported recoverable A+B+C1 oil reserves—considered roughly equivalent to the proven and probable reserve category in international nomenclature—amounted to around 3.25 billion tons (see Table 5.3 Kazakhstan's oil reserves in the A, B, C1, and C2 categories as of January 1, 2023).⁶ This represents a 0.9% decrease compared with the A+B+C1 reserve volume as reported at the beginning of 2022. S&P Global estimates Kazakhstan's remaining proven and probable reserves at around 3.48 billion tons (26.72 Bb) of crude oil and condensate at the end 2022.⁷ This volume is not substan- tially changed from our estimate given for 2020 in The National Energy Report 2021; no large discoveries were subsequently made (the last major discovery was Kashagan in 2000) but revisions and small discoveries were suﬃcient for general replacement of production). One sign of the times, in Kazakhstan in any event, is the downturn in company spending on exploration in recent years. Investment in geological exploration work by subsoil users in Kazakhstan during 2020-22 fell by 25% compared with the period 2017-19, amounting to around 314.4 billion tenge ($0.7 billion) in total during the latest three-year period. In 2023, only about $190 million (84.7 billion tenge) is expected to be spent by KMG for geological exploration of oil and ga s \u0000elds. One of this year's projects includes drilling a 5.5 km deep exploration well in the Paleozoic sediments in Kyzylorda Oblast. An exploration milestone during 2021-22 was nevertheless execution of Stage 1 of the “Eurasia” project to study deep horizons of the Precaspian Basin. Stage 1 consisted of a $6 million state-funded report prepared according to international standards and involving collection and reinterpretation of geophysical and geological materials by a consortium led by Kazakhstan's SPC GEOKEN LLP research foundation. Completion of Stage 1 (launched in March 2021 and \u0000nished in November 2022) conceptually lays the groundwork for more capital-intensive project work: a second stage including regional seismic surveying at an estimated cost of $150 million over 2.5 years, and a third stage involving the drilling of a 15 km well and costing an estimated $350 million over 3 years. Funding of the next stages is supposed to come from industry, but speci\u0000c sources remain to be identi\u0000ed, with the result that the schedule for additional project activity is also uncertain.⁸ 5.3.2 Recent production trends and outlook Kazakhstan produced 85.7 MMt (1.80 million b/d) of oil in 2020, 85.9 MMt (1.81 million b/d) in 2021, and 84.2 MMt (1.77 million b/d) in 2022. National production returns to a growth trajectory in 2023 on an annual basis in our base case, notwithstanding a number of new constraints this year. These include Kazakhstan's commitment in April 2023 to an additional crude oil output reduction within the framework of the OPEC+ alliance, and electric power outages in summer 2023 in particular that negatively impacted operations at various \u0000elds.⁹ National oil output is expected to reach a maximum of 105.4 MMt (2.23 million b/d) already in 2025, followed by a subsequent slow decline to 72.1 MMt (1.51 million b/d) in 2050. In our alternative high case, national output reaches a maximum of 118.9 MMt (2.51 million b/d) in 2035, and subsequently declines to 92.7 MMt (1.94 million b/d) in 2050, while in the low case the maximum is only 94.2 MMt (1.99 million b/d) in 2025 and production falls to 44.3 MMt (924,000 b/d) in 2050 (see Figure 5.3 Outlook for Kazakhstan's oil production by case). Key assumptions underlying the high case include relatively aggressive development of upstream acreage by smaller producers whose aggregate existing reserve base and production potential is sizable and may be augmented by “new” production from additional producers and additional discoveries. The main diﬀerence between the low case and the base case is the absence of a Kashagan Phase 2 expansion program.¹⁰ The three mega projects remain the primary drivers of the national production pr o\u0000le, especially in the near to medium term. In the base case, the “Big 3” share of Kazakh oil production rises from 63.1% in 2022 to a maximum of 71.0% in 2029—due mainly to TCO and NCOC expansion, and partial stabilization of KPO output (see Figure 5.4 Outlook for Kazakhstan's oil production by major project/region to 2050 in the base case). After 2030, the “Big 3” share is expected to gradually decline, to around 60% by 2050. A host of smaller projects contribute as well to Kazakhstan's oil development, albeit less prominently, and we also assume a relatively slow decline in Kazakhstan's older, legacy \u0000elds (especially in western Kazakhstan), r e\u0000ecting the growing application of new technology and improved production practices, which have the potential to signi\u0000cantly boost recovery coeﬃcients at Kazakh \u0000elds generally. Industrywide, the recovery coeﬃcient at \u0000elds in Kazakhstan averaged only 0.152 at last report, whereas a coeﬃcient of around 0.357 could be attainable, according to a Kazakh government estimate based on an analysis of international"}

KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR 118 We also believe that the pledge by Kazakhstan, coordinated with other members of OPEC+, to limit crude oil output in the remainder of 2023 and 2024 will not really act as much of a brake, and Kazakhstan will likely produce somewhere close to its maximum available capacity—assuming no disruptions in A+B+C1 C2 A+B+C1+C2 Crude oil Condensate T otal Table 5.3 Kazakhstan's oil reserves in the A, B, C1, and C2 categories as of January 1, 2023 (MМt) Source: Subsoil user data. © 2023 S&P Global.

Tengiz consortium (TCO) The T engiz project remains the largest Kazakh oil development by production, accounting for 34.6% of national oil output in 2022. Maximum annual T engiz production to date was registered in 2019, when output reached 29.8 MMt (649,000 b/d). In 2020, output fell to 26.5 MMt (576,000 b/d), r e\u0000ecting the impact of COVID-19 on global demand. Production partially recovered in 2021, and rose more signi\u0000cantly in 2022, to 29.2 MMt (636,000 b/d). In our base case, TCO production dips slightly in 2023, but then rebounds. The next phase of expansion, over 2024-25, is the Future Growth Project (FGP), with an estimated cost of $46.7 billion. The FGP is slated to add 12 MMt/y (260,000 b/d) to the \u0000eld's overall production capacity. The consortium partners took a \u0000nal investment decision (FID) for this project in mid-2016. First oil from the FGP is still expected in the second half of 2024. Following a quick ramp-up in production from the new capacity, to a new maximum output level of 42.0 MMt (915,000 b/d) in 2025, T engiz then enters a decline trajectory that leaves \u0000eld production at 9.9 MMt (216,000 b/d) in 2050 in the base case. Currently, we expect that in the post-plateau period, production at T engiz will experience a sizable secular decline, barring the implementation of another investment round by the JV to attenuate the decline. A critical factor will be the government's decisions about the project in 2033 when the current JV expires. Kashagan consortium (NCOC) In 2022, Kashagan output declined by 21.9% to 12.7 MMt (269,000 b/d) after an August gas leak necessitated emergency repairs that negatively impacted production. Kashagan's recovery and growth this year is expected to be a primary driver of the expansion of Kazakh oil production overall in 2023. Field output reaches 18.4 MMt (391,000 b/d) this year in the S&P Global base case. The consortium's current Phase 2 expansion program includes two separate projects now in the planning stages: Phase 2A aims to increase oil production to 500,000 b/d, and Phase 2B would raise output to a higher ceiling, eventually planned at about 700,000 b/d. ¹² Kashagan's future production trajectory varies widely in our scenarios depending on how Phase 2 is imple- mented. This two-pronged expansion goes forward more or less as planned in our base-case outlook, raising the \u0000eld's output to a maximum of 35.0 MMt/y (743,000 b/d) in 2040, while 2050 output is expected at 28.0 MMt (595,000 b/d). In the high case, the buildup is somewhat more rapid and brings production up to a maximum of 36.5 MMt (775,000 b/d) in 2040. In the low case, however, the second phase expansion is never sanctioned, so produc tion stretches to only about 22–23 MMt (470,000–480,000 b/d) through some additional minor debottlenecking, and in"}

Karachaganak consortium (KPO) Karachaganak's annual gross production of liquids has been basically \u0000at since 2007, ranging between about 11.3 MMt and 12.2 MMt (257,000–278,000 b/d); gross output in 2019 was 11.3 MMt (257,000 b/d), increasing to 12.2 MMt (277,000 b/d) in 2020, but amounting to 11.5 MMt (262,000 b/d) in 2021 and 11.3 MMt (257,000 b/d) in 2022. Karachaganak's liquids output is mainly condensate, so its operation has been exempt from OPEC+ restrictions. Field production loses approximately 18–19% of its volume in the process of stabilization (now undertaken entirely at the \u0000eld itself; previously some took place within Russia), and this signi\u0000cantly reduces the liquids volumes available for pipeline shipment or exports. Karachaganak's fourth stabilization train 12 S&P Gobal Commodity Insights, Platts Commodity News, Kazakhstan Kashagan expansion progressing ‘well,’ amid legal battle, 16 June 2023.KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR % 120 (part of the project's second expansion phase), installed in 2010, increased the project's direct export capacity to 10.3 MMt (234,000 b/d) of stabilized liquids. T o help maintain production, a gas debottlenecking project was launched in 2018 and was completed in March 2021. In December 2020, a general and amicable settlement between KPO and the government ended a long-standing dispute surrounding the pr o\u0000t oil formula in the 1997 production-sharing agreement. This settlement in turn set the stage for initiation of a larger project, aimed at maintaining liquids production at 10–11 MMt/y (215,000-237,000 b/d) in the longer term, through more gas reinjection, known as PRK-1A (or KEP-1A), and this project is expected to be completed in 2025.¹³ Gross Karachaganak production nevertheless enters a long-term decline trajectory at around this same time in our base case, and gradually falls to 5.0 MMt (114,000 b/d) in 2050. Other existing production streams ► Western Kazakhstan legacy producers. Production in this category (not to be confused with Kazakhstan's oblast of the same name) covers the output of \u0000ve legacy Soviet-era oil producers, including the fully-owned KMG production subsidiaries, OzenMunayGaz and EmbaMunayGaz. Output by this mature group of producers will continue the general (albeit slow) decline that began in 2006–07 over the remainder of the outlook period; an above-average reduction in output in 2020–21 was followed by a slight uptick in 2022, to 17.0 MMt (324,000 b/d), but aggregate production for this group returns to a decline trajectory in 2023 in the base case, and falls to 10.5 MMt (200,000 b/d) in 2050. The decline rate in this category may nevertheless be further attenuated through timely implementation of various measures currently under way or in the planning stages. The KMG program to slow or reverse mature \u0000eld decline rates involves a combination of hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling, steam injection and polymer injection. KMG is also exploring the potential to enhance oil recovery at depleted oil reservoirs by means of C О₂ injection within the framework of a carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) project, as part of the company's 2022-2031 Low Carbon Development Program.¹⁴ ► Aktobe Oblast. This region's production has generally been declining since 2013, and in 2022 amounted to 4.5 MMt (95,000 b/d); output is expected to fall further from current levels, to 2.8 MMt (59,000 b/d) in 2050. ► Turgay Basin (Kyzylorda Oblast). Regional production has been slowly falling since 2007, to the level of 4.0 MMt (84,000 b/d) in 2022; the outlook is for further decline, to 2.4 MMt (51,000 b/d) in 2050. ► Other (JVs, etc.). Crude oil produced by this category includes all onshore oil production from all other producers. This category comprises projects run mainly by small JVs and other international independents. In 2022, there were more than 50 producing entities within this category. Located predominantly in western Kazakhstan (mainly in Atyrau and Mangystau oblasts, although there is one in West Kazakhstan Oblast and one in East Kazakhstan Oblast), these projects' output has been about 5.3–6.0 MMt (102,000–115,000 b/d) in recent years. Although output for the category contracted overall in 2019–20, it partially recovered in 2021-22, reaching 5.6 MMt (108,000 b/d) in 2022. These producers' output is expected to expand some over the longer term, to a maximum of 6.6 MMt (127,000 b/d) in 2045 in the base case, and amount to 6.5 MMt (125,000 b/d) in 2050. Oﬀshore development post-Kashagan Some oﬀshore production streams aside from the Kashagan \u0000eld are likely to emerge during the outlook period, facilitated in part by positive developments on the regulatory front in recent years; e.g., the government's 2021 decision to waive export duties on crude produced by new oﬀshore projects and the 2023 adoption of the Improved Model Contract (IMC) regulatory and tax framework for complex upstream projects. But such policy improvements fail to ameliorate a number of key \u0000scal and other above-ground risks; these continue to challenge the attractive- ness of developing additional shelf acreage for outside investors.¹⁵ Production from these other oﬀshore \u0000elds will be driven by a combination of geology and investment conditions, and the range of what is possible is quite broad. Our outlook assumes some exploration success, although no new discoveries on the scale of Kashagan are made. The base case envisages output from this category starting in 2030, and key sources of production include the r econ\u0000gured Kalamkas-More/Khazar project, now moving forward into implementation within the framework of a joint venture between KMG and Lukoil on IMC terms. Overall, however, exploration and production in the Kazakh oﬀshore post-Kashagan is expected to move rather slowly. One signpost is that a \u0000rst exploration well drilled by another KMG-Lukoil JV in 2023 at the Zhenis block, within the framework of another JV, was unsuccessful; the partners subsequently announced that they were closing the project and returning the license block to the state. The net result is that aggregate growth of oﬀshore production from sources other than Kashagan is limited to only 7.0 MMt (149,000 b/d) in 2050 in the base case. 5.3.3 Development of laws and regula- tions governing upstream operations Kazakhstan has taken important steps recently to rationalize \u0000scal and"}

For example: ► in 2016 an ad hoc and non-transparent export tax system was replaced with an explicit oil export customs duty formula based on a sliding scale linked to world oil prices; ► in 2018, the Subsoil Code was introduced, replacing the Law on Subsoil and improving subsoil auction procedures; Tax Code amendments approved around the same time provided 13 S&P Global Commodity Insights, Insight, Karachaganak partners and Kazakhstan nally resolve their long-standing dispute, December 2020. 14 KMG has begun screening \u0000elds among the company portfolio to select a reservoir for C О₂ injection, and early indications are that the acreage of its OzenMunayGaz subsidiary is most suitable for this purpose. The company is also seeking to learn from the CCUS experience of Chevron, with whom KMG signed a memorandum of understanding in June 2022 to jointly explore low- carbon opportunities in Kazakhstan.15 The above-ground risks were underscored once again in April 2023 by Kazakhstan's decision to launch multi-billion dollar arbitration proceedings against the NCOC consortium, along with the KPO consortium, alleging that the state's share of revenue should be higher under terms of the production- sharing agreements governing the projects. See S&P Global Commodity Insights, Energy T echnical Report, Kazakhstan Sues Operators of Karachaganak and Kashagan, April 2023.KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR 121 new \u0000scal incentives for selected upstream investments, including introduction of an Alternative Subsoil Use Tax (ASUT) for speci\u0000ed technologically complex projects; ► in 2022, a Subsoil Code amendment introduced the concept of “unconventional hydrocarbons” (including “shale oil”), facilitating the booking and development of reserves within these categories; ► in early 2023, IMC legislation was enacted oﬀering additional \u0000scal relief for complex projects among other new incentives; ► and over the course of 2020-23 Kazakhstan launched and developed an ongoing electronic (online) auctioning procedure for E&P blocks.¹⁶ 5.3.3.1 Improved Model Contract (IMC) At the beginning of 2023, amendments and additions were completed to the relevant legislative acts in Kazakhstan, providing for the introduction of the IMC—a new subsoil contract option. The IMC aims to increase competitiveness and create conditions for attracting additional investments in the exploration of complex upstream projects; it is applicable to oﬀshore and gas projects as well as to complex onshore projects. The IMC provides some incentives (or “preferences”) that re \u0000ect a recognition by the Kazakh authorities of the special challenges involved in the development of its complex hydrocarbon deposits. Eligibility for the IMC is de\u0000ned by technical characteristics of the \u0000eld or geographic location (oﬀshore, subsalt, under-explored basins, etc.). Substantive IMC incentives feature stability guarantees for selected \u0000scal and regulatory preferences, including reduced ASUT rates for complex oﬀshore \u0000elds (see Figure 5.6 ASUT tax rates for complex oﬀshore projects versus other projects), special amortization options for expenses incurred prior to the start of production, an option for interna- tional arbitration, and relaxed requirements for supplying crude oil to the domestic market.¹⁷ However, S&P Global's analysis indicates that the IMC terms probably do not go far enough to stimulate new upstream investment on the scale sought by Kazakhstan, especially in the current in\u0000ationary and geopolitical environment, and the current IMC regime actually retains several problematic aspects of the typical (existing) model contract (Subsoil Use Contract) that applies to less complex \u0000elds; e.g., both sorts of contracts include language that lacks clarity and transparency—for example, regarding local content rules. On balance, S&P Global concludes that the IMC fails to fully ameliorate a number of impediments that continue to challenge the attractiveness of developing these resources to outside investors: general taxes, environmental, and general regulatory terms that are not “locked” and stable throughout the project lifetime; onerous local content require- ments for labor, equipment, and services (somewhat counterintuitive given the fact that development of many complex deposits would demand the highest level of international expertise); persistent administrative rigidities (e.g., annual work program reporting requirements); continued requirements for unrelated social and economic investments by companies in the regions in which their operations are located; and the require- ment of a signing bonus. 5.3.3.2 Online auctions Starting in 2020, Kazakhstan has been holding online auctions of E&P acreage, following Subsoil Code amendments to allow for this form of licensing, involving blocks across key petroleum basins in the country. A total of six such online auctions have now been held—one in 2020, two in 2021, two in 2022, and one so far in 2023 (a second 2023 auction is scheduled to take place on October 20). As noted in The National Energy Report 2021 , the results of the initial auctions in 2020-21 fell short of expectations, as key international majors did not participate. The IOCs did not bid either in the 2022 online auctions or the \u0000rst 2023 auction held in July, though one leading foreign NOC, Sinopec, bid in the December 2022 auction (and won an exploration block in the Precaspian Basin; Mangystau Oblast). The chief precondition for increased participation in online auctions—by foreign investors in particular—seemingly remains more systematic reform of Kazakhstan's upstream regulatory regime, including removal of the same sort of impediments that tend to limit investment within the IMC framework as noted above. Key overall results of the online auctions held to date include the following (see Table 5.4 Comparison of the Kazakh Energy Ministry's online auctions for E&P blocks, 2020-23 (key indica- tors) and Table 5.5 Results of the Kazakh Energy Ministry's July 12, 2023 online auction for E&P blocks): ► Nearly 70 elds/blocks have been auctioned oﬀ so far on the online format, but the number of cancelations of planned bidding rounds has been even greater, largely due to an insuﬃcient number of participants. For example, out of an initial 56 hydrocarbon plays for which the Energy Ministry invited bids in advance of the July 2023 auction, only 9 were ultimately bid on by investors. ► Over 60% of the blocks/elds that have been awarded are located in the Precaspian Basin.

For example, draft amendments to the Subsoil Code submitted to the Mazhilis (lower chamber of parlia- ment) include a proposal to increase the threshold for divergence between planned and actual project indica- tors—above which project documentation must be amended—from 10% to 30% in the case of projects involving small \u0000elds.¹⁸ ► Delineation of more “low-risk” exploration plays, including prospects for joint development with foreign investors. In line with the above-noted global trend of greater orienta- tion around “low-risk” E&P opportunities (see Chapter 1), it may make sense to prioritize more accessible plays, including shallow-water and onshore exploration targets near known deposits. This strategy has the advantage of minimizing both risks and costs. ► Timely completion of plans to digitize geological data and make this available online to prospective investors. In November 2022, the Kaznedra Information Platform (minerals.gov.kz) began operating in pilot mode, after repeated delays, in advance of a planned full-scale launch in 2023. Electronic versions of over 30,000 geological reports are on oﬀer, and all remaining geological materials that are not classi\u0000ed or con\u0000dential are supposed to become available in digital format by 2025.¹⁹ ► Enactment of additional scal incentives for development of more challenging acreage (see below).5.3.3.4 Upstream taxation conditions Hydrocarbon producers in Kazakhstan are subject to a variety of taxes under the regular \u0000scal regime, while three taxes in particular account for a major share of total take for the typical producer (see Table 5.6 Taxes applicable to subsoil users in Kazakhstan in 2022): ► Mineral Resource Extraction Tax (MRET). The MRET is a royalty-like tax on crude oil and gas condensate production (and also to natural gas output); the taxable base is the value of production. The MRET ad valorem rate escalates depending on a company's annual production volume (but not price). The MRET levies for crude oil that is exported are twice as high as for domestic deliveries; i.e., a coeﬃcient of 0.5 is applied to the MRET rate in the case of crude oil produced for the domestic market. For selected \u0000elds with challenging economics, the government sometimes grants signi\u0000cant MRET reductions; e.g., KMG's OzenMunayGaz subsidiary quali\u0000ed for a lower rate under terms of a government resolution published"}

The export duty on crude oil varies on a monthly basis according to a sliding scale tied to world oil prices. Kazakhstan's crude export duty rates are listed in US dollars per ton correspond- ing to oil price bands, and established by the Ministry of National Economy. Exports to EAEU markets are exempt from the export duty. One signi\u0000cant adjustment to the export duty in February 2023 was the adoption of a new oil price series for purposes of calculating the export duty rate: Kazakhstan's relatively high-priced KEBCO grade replaced Russia's Urals Blend in the tax formula. In August 2023, the methodology for calculating the export duty was also revised. Under the new procedure, the duty now varies across three oil price categories: below $25/bbl, the duty is not collected; at prices between $25/bbl and $105/bbl, the duty equates to the average market price in dollars per barrel during the previous month, levied per each metric ton of exported oil (e.g., if the price during the previous month was $25/bbl, then the export duty is $25 per metric ton); and at prices above 18 KPMG, Legal Alert, Draft Law of the RK on the issues of improving the sphere of subsoil use, June 2023, https://kpmg.com/kz/en/home/insights/2023/06/legal- alert.html. 19 Inbusiness.kz, Natsgeosluzhba: Zagruzim vsyu geologicheskuyu otchetnost v sistemu \"Kaznedra\" k 2025 godu, 1 March 2023, https://inbusiness.kz/ru/news/nacgeosluzhba-zagruzim-vsyu-geologicheskuyu- otchetnost-v-sistemu-kaznedra-k-2025-godu.KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR Kozha South block Shalva \u0000eld Pustynnoe \u0000eld Tazhigali Southwes t \u0000eld Oymaut block Tastobe block Zhubant am \u0000eld Balykshy block Kumysbek \u0000eldPrecaspian Mangyshlak Precaspian Precaspian Precaspian Mangyshlak Precaspian Precaspian PrecaspianAtyrau Mangystau Atyrau Atyrau Aktobe Mangystau Atyrau Atyrau Atyrau1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 925 112 5 5 2,187 90 4 1,583 326 56,572 632,396 3,046,426 1,299,131 219,325 56,300 181,022 1,281,034 592,871 145% 311% 885% 377% 204% 144% 95% 564% 671%1) Drilling – 1 well 1) Drilling – 2 wells n/a n/a 1) Drilling – 2 wells 1) Drilling – 2 wells n/a 1) Drilling – 3 wells n/a 2,500,000 5,000,000 n/a n/a 6,000,000 5,000,000 n/a 5,500,000 n/aPetroGas WK LLP Ark Petroleum LLP Priority Oil & Gas LLP Big Steps LLP Baytak Kurylys LLP Nomad West Oil LLP BlackGold Energy LLP Prosperity Oil & Gas LLP Big Steps LLP 124 $105/bbl, one of nine diﬀerent export duty rates applies depending on the price level.²⁰ ► Rent tax on exports. An unusual \u0000scal instrument in global practice, the Kazakh rent tax applies to the value of exported crude oil and gas condensate. The tax rate increases with the oil price once the price exceeds $50/bbl, ranging up to 32%. Oil exports from Kazakhstan are thus subject to two types of export taxes. In contrast to the export duty, the rent tax on exports applies to exports to EAEU markets along with other export markets. Kazakh authorities have traditionally relied primarily on interna- tional pricing agencies for the speci\u0000c price quotes used for tax calculation purposes (i.e., Platts and Argus). Going forward, however, one \u0000scal reform under consideration by policymakers is a change in the method for calculating the global oil price used in tax formulas whereby the average “realized price” as determined in accordance with Kazakh regulations governing transfer pricing would be used instead of quotes from pricing agencies. At the same time, Brent remains the key international benchmark oil price for use in Kazakh authorities' macroeconomic forecasts and budget planning process, and the government's outlook for Kazakhstan's socio-economic development during 2024-28 (issued in May 2023) envisages an average Brent price during this period of $80/bbl.²¹ As noted in Chapter 1, a low \u0000scal systems rating is one of the primary reasons for Kazakhstan's below-average score in S&P Global's E&P attractiveness ratings for hydrocarbon-producing countries. There is considerable scope for improvement of the current tax regime, including adoption of new measures targeting selected older acreage as well as gr een\u0000eld projects:► Fiscal stimulus measures targeting mature elds. For instance, KMG has embarked on a rehabilitation project involving the Uzen and Karamandybas \u0000elds and is counting on the government to approve a reduction of the MRET rate for these \u0000elds' production from 13% to 2.6%. Such a tax break would facilitate a bigger KMG spending program needed to achieve a planned production increase at the acreage in question on the order of over 500,000 tons per year by 2029. Expansion of the ASUT zone to include mature \u0000elds is another promising option for tax reform.²² ► Additional tax incentives for Kazakhstan's nascent shale oil industry. Earlier this year, Kazakhstan's private sector South Oil company announced the discovery of a shale oil deposit that is in the Karaganda-Kyzylorda regions. South Oil has reportedly embarked on what will be the country's \u0000rst shale oil development project, but S&P Global concludes that Kazakhstan is still lacking suﬃcient \u0000scal incentives for full- scale development of such reserves, particularly during the capital-intensive early project stages.²³ Tax credits were a key factor (among other enablers) in jump-starting the large-scale production of unconventional hydrocarbons in the United States, while Russian tax exemptions for shale plays have also contributed to the development of that country's shale oil industry on a more modest scale.Applicable tax Rate/taxable base Bonuses (signature) Variable Mineral Resources Extraction Tax (MRET) 5–18% for oil and 10% for gas Excess pr o\u0000t tax (EPT) 0–60% Rent tax on exports* 0–32% Payment for compensation of historical costs Variable Excise tax on crude and gas condensate 0 tenge per metric ton Alternative subsurface use tax (ASUT) 0–30% Value-added tax (VAT) 1.2% Crude oil export duty Variable; levied per ton based on rates tied to global oil prices Land tax Usually immaterial for oil and gas producers Property tax 1.5% Environmental fees and charges V ariable Other fees (e.g., fee for use of radio frequencies, fee for use of navigable waterways) Variable Other taxes and payments V ariable Table 5.6 Taxes applicable to subsoil users in Kazakhstan"}

Crude Oil Transportation 5.4.1 Existing capacity of export infra- structure T otal annual capacity of Kazakhstan's overland pipeline crude oil export system is on the order of 109.5 MMt (2.19 million b/d), including the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC²⁴) route (72.5 MMt or 1.45 million b/d; 78 MMt or 1.56 million b/d with drag- reducing agents), the Atyrau-Samara pipeline network (17.5 MMt, 350,000 b/d), and the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline (KCP²⁵) (20 MMt, 400,000 b/d), with about half of KCP booked for Russian transit crude. There is also a small amount of rail capacity available (up to 3 MMt or 60,000 b/d) to export crude to neighboring Uzbekistan or to Russian ports on the Black or Baltic seas. Kazakhstan can export crude as well via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC²⁶) pipeline from Azerbaijan, which has a nameplate capacity of 60 MMt (1.2 million b/d) and has been substantially underutilized in recent years. However, to reach Baku, crude has to be shipped across the Caspian Sea. The major constraining factor for Kazakhstan's exports on the route centers on tanker availability in the Caspian Sea and bottlenecks at the Kazakhstan's Aktau port. Other potential export routes transiting Azerbaijan are the outlets to marine terminals on Georgia's Black Sea coast: the Baku-Batumi rail route²⁷ or the Baku-Supsa pipeline. ²⁸ Given Kazakhstan's landlocked location in the heart of the Eurasian continent, export capacity has traditionally been one of the greatest challenges for oil producers in Kazakhstan. Russian routes have remained the chief outlets for Kazakh oil exports by far because all of the alternative export routes—across the Caspian Sea and through the Caucasus or eastward to mainland China—face a combination of market-driven, economic, and logistical challenges. Most of Kazakhstan's pipeline exports via Russia move through the CPC pipeline, terminating at the Black Sea terminal of Yuzhnaya Ozereyevka. Additional Kazakh oil export streams are channeled via the Russian pipeline system operated by Transneft. Kazakh crude enters the Transneft pipeline system either via the Atyrau-Samara pipeline or at Makhachkala after crossing the Caspian Sea from Aktau by tanker. But because most Kazakh export routes involve transit through third countries, and Russia in particular, concerns about the reliability of some routes have long driven Kazakh policymakers to embrace a “multi-vectoral” strategy of multiple routes going in every direction—north, south, east, and west. Kazakhstan has intensi\u0000ed its oil export div ersi\u0000cation program since February 2022 in light of the added risks associated with Russian tran- sit—including risks of Russia's curtailment of access to the CPC and Transneft routes as well as Ukrainian attacks on tankers loading at Russian Black Sea terminals (as underscored by an August 2023 Ukrainian drone strike on a Russian oil tanker in the Black Sea). The initial focus of Kazakhstan's export div ersi\u0000cation eﬀorts has been on trans-Caspian shipment routes. A host of logistical and transportation cost constraints among other obstacles will nonetheless continue to limit the scale of Kazakh oil export streams bypassing Russian territory to a relatively small share of total Kazakh exports for the foreseeable future.²⁹ 5.4.2 Recent export trends and outlook Kazakh oil exports fell overall in 2022 by 0.8% to 65.2 MMt (1.30 million b/d). Altogether, Russian routes handled over 95% of Kazakh oil export volumes in 2022, concentrated mainly in the CPC pipeline as well as the Atyrau-Samara routes through the Transneft pipeline system (see Figure 5.7 Kazakhstanʼs oil (crude + condensate) exports via selected routes in 2022). Export trends will likely continue to largely follow the national oil production dynamic, rising slightly in 2023 and reach a maximum of 84.2 MMt (1.68 million b/d) in 2025 before dropping to around 50 MMt (1 million b/d) in 2050. The share of Kazakh oil exports transiting Russia declines signi\u0000cantly during the outlook period, but Russian routes are still expected to handle 79% of the total in 2050 (see Figure 5.8 Outlook for Kazakhstan's crude oil exports to 2050 by route). European markets, the primary destination of Kazakh oil exports historically, are likely to remain important destinations over the outlook period. But Asia P aci\u0000c countries will probably take a growing share of total Kazakh oil exports going forward, given the concentration of global oil demand growth in the Asia P aci\u0000c region—involving greater exports via the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline (KCP) route and perhaps increased long-haul tanker shipments from the Black Sea and Baltic Sea ports as well. Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) In 2022 Kazakhstan's CPC exports dipped by 0.2% to 53.5 MMt (1.07 million b/d), representing 82.1% of total Kazakh oil exports in that year. CPC continues to handle the bulk of Kazakhstan's oil exports throughout the scenario period, and through the mid- 2020s CPC is likely to see a marked increase in throughput as T engiz ramps up production and exports—facilitated in part by a $600 million CPC debottlenecking project that was completed in 2022. 24 CPC shareholders are the Russian Federation (31%; represented by PJSC Transneft with 24% and CPC Co. with 7%), Kazakhstan (20.75%; represented"}

The \u0000rst was the weather-related damage to the terminal's loading hoses in March 2022. Another occurred in June 2022 when a shutdown occurred to address the issue of unexploded WW2-era ordnance in the vicinity of the CPC terminal. In July 2022, a Russian court–ordered closure of the CPC termi- nal—purportedly after an audit revealed “violations under the oil spill response plan”—was only narrowly averted when a regional court upheld an appeal and instead imposed an administrative \u0000ne.³⁰ But barring a prolonged interruption of Kazakh oil exporters' access to CPC (not currently expected), this export route continues to enjoy a number of distinct overriding advan-tages—including a crude quality bank and a competitive and predictable tariﬀ as well as some spare capacity. In short, CPC has generally been an excellent and reliable route. Kazakh shippers continue to prefer the route given priority shipping rights and attractive economics. The net result is that CPC will likely continue to attract Kazakh oil export volumes, notwithstanding the new geopolitical downside risks. After 2025, Kazakh exports via CPC are expected to slowly contract, to the level of around 37 MMt (740,000 b/d) in 2050, or around 69% of the 2022 volume, but this still represents an estimated 75% of total Kazakh oil exports in 2050. 30 S&P Global Commodity Insights, Headline Analysis, Russian-ordered CPC pipeline halt exposes Kazakhstan's oil export vulnerability, July 2022.Figure 5.8 Outlook for Kazakhstan's crude oil exports to 2050 by route Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights (Eurasian Oil Export Outlook). © 2023 S&P Global.MМtOther Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline KCP (Kazakh crude) To Russian r e\u0000neries and Orenburg Ust-Luga (BPS-2)Rail exports via Russia to Baltic and Black sea ports Batumi Novorossiysk CPC (Yuzhnaya Ozereyevka) CPC share of total (right axis) 100 020406080 020406080100 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2050 % 127 Atyrau-Samara (Transneft) routes Exports via the Atyrau-Samara pipeline system fell by 22.4% in 2022 to 9.4 MMt (188,000 b/d), and accounted for 14.5% of the total. Kazakhstan's 2022 exports via Transneft's Black Sea outlet at Novorossiysk—including only the pipeline deliveries from the direction of Samara and not the separate stream of Transneft pipeline deliveries from Russia's Caspian Sea Makhachkala terminal—fell by 27.2% to 4.9 MMt (98,000 b/d), while exports via the Transneft Baltic Sea outlet at Ust-Luga were down 16.5% to 4.5 MMt (90,000 b/d). As discussed in Chapter 1, Kazakhstan's June 2022 KEBCO rebranding was instrumental in diﬀerentiating Kazakh oil export streams delivered via Transneft pipeline from Russia's Urals Blend, and thereby strengthening prices for such exports even as Urals continued to sell at a relatively steep discount to Brent. Price quotes for Kazakh oil volumes exported via Transneft routes may nevertheless be negatively impacted by increased wariness of would-be importers with respect to shipments from Russian territory (irrespective of the ultimate country of origin), while the reluctance of various shipowners to load at Russian ports may translate into increased insurance and freight costs for Kazakh exporters who ship via these terminals. Kazakhstan began exporting oil to Germany in 2023 along another route accessed via Transneft's network—the Druzhba pipeline. Kazakh oil deliveries to Germany via the northern segment of the Druzhba began in February 2023—the \u0000rst time since 2013 that Kazakhstan made use of the Druzhba export route—following agreement with Russia on transit terms. There are plans to send a total of 1.2 MMt (24,000 b/d) of Kazakh oil altogether via this route in 2023; on June 21, 2023, KMG signed an agreement for the supply of 100,000 tons per month to Germany's Schwedt r e\u0000nery until the end of 2023. Kazakh oil exports via the Atyrau-Samara outlets decline to less than half of the 2022 volume by 2050 in our base case, falling to less than 4 MMt/y (80,000) in 2050; Druzhba is expected to remain a major channel for this reduced volume (handling almost 2 MMt"}

Kazakhstan-China Pipeline (KCP) Kazakh oil exports via KCP surged by 29% in 2022 to 1.2 MMt (24,000 b/d), while total shipments in the pipeline—including Kazakh crude and, predominantly, Russian crude—rose slightly in 2022, to 11.1 MMt (222,000 b/d).³¹ In April 2023, KMG announced that the company and CNPC were considering the possibility of increasing deliveries of Kazakh oil to mainland China, and in May the two companies reportedly agreed to expand the KCP pipeline; KMG announced that Kazakhstan plans to export as much as 20 MMt/y (400,000 b/d) to China. Kazakh exports via KCP remain well below this level in our current outlook, reaching a maximum of 6.5 MMt (130,000 b/d) in 2045, before falling to 5.0 (100,000 b/d) in 2050. The KCP export route is expected to be the main alternative to reliance on Russian transit during the outlook period (though Russian volumes in KCP continue to exceed Kazakh volumes). KCP pipeline capacity amounts to 20 MMt/y (400,000 b/d) for the eastern-most segment of the route (e.g., Atasu-Alashankou). The remainder of the pipeline is expected to be upgraded to 20 MMt/y in the coming years. Larger-scale utilization of KCP depends partly on the full reversal in \u0000ow direction of an existing pipeline that extends from Atyrau to Kenkiyak, still expected to occur sometime in the near future. In 2022, a sizable \u0000ow westward of Aktobe crude into the Atyrau-Samara pipeline continued (i.e., from Kenkiyak to Atyrau), limiting the \u0000ow eastward into the KCP pipeline. When the permanent change in \u0000ow direction is implemented, the KCP will be able to regularly access up to 6 MMt/y (120,000 b/d) of crude from the main oil-producing area in northwestern Kazakhstan. But key factors constraining a ramp-up of Kazakh volumes in KCP include relatively high transportation tariﬀs and a comparatively low sales price at the China border.³² Trans-Caspian routes Kazakhstan's trans-Caspian oil export volumes fell to only 0.3 MMt (6,000 b/d) in 2021 (the lowest level in over two decades), but jumped nearly four-fold in 2022 to 1.2 MMt (24,000 b/d). Whereas during 2019-21 all of Kazakh trans-Caspian exports were directed into the Russian route (Makhachkala), the Russian share dropped to 72% in 2022, as Kazakhstan restarted exports via both the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline (for the \u0000rst time since 2015) and the Baku-Batumi rail route (for the \u0000rst time since 2017). The BTC route is set to take a growing share of Kazakh trans- Caspian volumes (after carrying only 25,000 tons or 500 b/d of Kazakh oil in 2022), with implementation starting in 2023 of a 5- year KMG contract with SOCAR envisioning 1.5 MMt/y (30,000 b/d) of oil exports via BTC. KMG's trans-Caspian shipments of oil for delivery to BTC steadily ramped up in the \u0000rst half of 2023, and during April-June reached 347,100 tons (or around 28,000 b/d on an annual basis). One signi\u0000cant change from The National Energy Report 2021 in terms of the mix of export outlets is that we now envision the BTC pipeline as carrying Kazakh oil in our base case throughout the period to 2050. In the base case, Kazakhstan's trans-Caspian oil export volumes reach a maximum of 3.9 MMt (78,000 b/d) in 2030, after which trans-Caspian exports gradually decline, falling to 3.2 MMt (64,000 b/d) in 2050 (see Figure 5.9 Kazakhstan's trans-Caspian crude oil exports by route in the S&P Global base case ). The share of Kazakhstan's trans-Caspian oil exports channeled via non- Russian routes reaches 62% in 2023, and continues rising 31 Rosneft supplies around 5 MMt/y (100,000 b/d) to the Pavlodar r e\u0000nery, and in exchange KMG delivers an equivalent volume via KCP to CNPC, with which Rosneft has a contract to supply a total of 10 MMt/y (200,000 b/d). Rosneft's contract was renewed in May 2023 through 2034. 32 The KCP route involves substantial transportation outlays because of the distance across Kazakhstan: across the Munaitas (Atyrau-Kenkiyak), Kenkiyak- Kumkol, Kumkol-Karakoin, Karakoin-Atasu, and Atasu-Alashankou pipeline segments for shippers from Atyrau and Mangystau oblasts. From Atyrau, these expenses amount to about $45 per ton, plus an additional transfer fee at Atasu of about $0.66/bbl. Although a special “unit tariﬀ” covering the entire route is eventually planned to be introduced, there is a limit to what can be done to reduce transportation tariﬀs given the distances involved and the fact that diﬀerent companies own and operate various segments of the KCP. Second, the border price is subject to a $5.33/bbl discount to BFOE (the Brent-Forties- Oseberg-Ek o\u0000sk crude grade) under terms of the current sales price formula. The price r e\u0000ects China's internal economic calculations, and it is set to make Kazakh and Russian crude r e\u0000ning in inland r e\u0000neries competitive against re\u0000ned products derived from seaborne crude in eastern China. These two dynamics yield a fairly unattractive netback. Finally, there is a longer-term question surrounding the potential demand for additional crude oil by inland Chinese r e\u0000ners that the pipeline serves. T o date, it does not appear that these re\u0000ners are in position to take much larger Kazakh (or Russian) volumes.KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR 128 throughout the period of the base case, to 94% in 2050. BTC handles the bulk of Kazakhstan's trans-Caspian shipments for the non-Russian routes as the amount going to Batumi by rail remains negligible. 5.4.3 Key obstacles to larger-scale trans-Caspian exports: Challenging economics and infrastructure con- straints Kazakh authorities have ambitions for a much larger increase in trans-Caspian oil export volumes than this; the government's target is for 20 MMt/y (400,000 b/d), and oﬃcial plans in the near term include an increase of trans-Caspian oil export capacity to 15 MMt/y (300,000 b/d) by 2025. But prospects for the trans- Caspian route developing such a large export channel still seem fairly remote given the relatively unattractive netbacks on oﬀer—compared with netbacks available from exports via the primary Russian routes in any event—and logistics constraints. 5.4.3.1 Trans-Caspian export netbacks versus the alternatives Russia has remained the chief route for Kazakh"}

In short, the CPC and the Atyrau-Samara outlets oﬀer better export netbacks than the non-Russian alternatives. An S&P Global assessment of netbacks via selected Kazakh oil export routes from Atyrau in 2023 concluded that the CPC netback was around $534/ton ($68/bbl) and the Atyrau-Samara outlet netbacks were in the range of $522-546/ton ($72-75/bbl); the trans-Caspian route netbacks were in the range of $446- 474/ton ($61-62/bbl), and a netback for KCP exports of $477/ton ($63/bbl) (see Figure 5.10 Estimated Kazakh crude oil export netbacks from Atyrau via selected routes in March 2023). The netback available from trans-Caspian shipment \u0000uctuates signi\u0000cantly over time, but some reduction of trans-Caspian transportation costs could be expected longer term given the impact of improved economies of scale, greater eﬃciencies, and infrastructure debottlenecking as volumes increase. But trans- Caspian route netbacks will likely remain inferior to netbacks available via Russia routes for the foreseeable future. Currently, the cost of trans-Caspian shipments is estimated at up to nearly three times the cost of CPC shipments. The single largest cost component of the overall trans-Caspian route (from Atyrau) is rail to Aktau—estimated at nearly $60/ton ($8.2/bbl) (see Figure 5.11. Estimated breakdown of transportation costs for Kazakh oil exports from Atyrau via selected trans-Caspian routes in March 2023). ³³Figure 5.9 Kazakhstan's trans-Caspian crude oil exports by route in the S&P Global base case (MМt) Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights (Eurasian Oil Export Outlook). © 2023 S&P Global.81012Makhachkala-Novorossiysk Batumi Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline Exports to Azerbaijan Iran 0246 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR 33 In the future, assuming larger volumes, this cost could be reduced signi\u0000cantly with the construction of a 830-km pipeline within Kazakhstan to move oil south and west. KTO's existing pipeline system carries oil in the opposite direction, from the Buzachi-Mangyshlak producing \u0000elds north to Atyrau. However, some \u0000elds, to the north and west of Aktau (e.g., Karazhanbas and Kalamkas), can access Aktau directly by KTO pipe. Such exports have a very diﬀerent cost structure; not surprisingly, these producers tend to use the trans-Caspian route because of the savings in transportation expenses compared to the KTO route to Atyrau-Samara. Overland costs for them to reach Aktau are only about $3/ton ($0.4/bbl) using the KTO pipeline. Another obvious reduction in costs could come from the installation of single-point mooring buoys at the Caspian ports to facilitate loading and unloading of tankers. 129 Figure 5.10 Estimated Kazakh crude oil export netbacks from Atyrau via selected routes in March 2023 Note s: Netback estimates do not include calculation of taxes applying to exporters.

But it is clear that Kazakhstan's existing Caspian tanker \u0000eet and marine terminal infrastructure cannot currently handle trans-Caspian shipments at anywhere near the scale ultimately targeted by Kazakh authorities (and some debottlenecking of Azeri terminal facilities may also be a prerequisite for much larger volumes). Kazakhstan's Caspian tank er \u0000eet: Increasingly stretched Kazakhstan's maritime shipping involves both state-owned and private companies. The leading players are evidently state- controlled Kazmor trans\u0000ot (KMTF), which was established by the Kazakh government in 1998 to spearhead development of a Kazakh merchant marine \u0000eet, and the private sector Mobilex Energy company, established in 2002. Although KMTF and Mobilex diﬀer in key respects, the characteristics of their oil tanker \u0000eets are quite similar. These companies' oil tankers were built by Russia's Vyborg Shipyard during 2005-06, according to the speci\u0000cations of the Vympel Design Bureau in Nizhny Novgorod, and all are in the 12,000-13,000 deadweight ton (dwt) range; i.e., Caspimax-class vessels, the maximum tanker size that the relatively shallow waters of the Caspian Sea terminals can typically accommodate (it is estimated that a tanker of this size can transport about 1 MMt/y or 20,000 b/d between Aktau and Baku): ► KMTF's Caspian oil tanker eet consists of three 12,400 dwt vessels: Astana (completed in 2005), Almaty (2005), and Aktau (2006). Earlier this year KMTF and a JV partner, UAE's Abu Dhabi Ports Group (AD Ports), purchased two additional tankers, each with a deadweight of 8,000 tons. Supplied by the Netherlands-based Damen Shipyards, the two new tankers will assist with deliveries of T engiz oil to the BTC injection point within the framework of the above-noted KMG-SOCAR contract. ► Mobilex Energy owns two oil tankers of about 12,000 dwt, Kazakhstan and Abay, both built in 2005. Available Aktau port oil shipping data indicate that other companies are relatively minor players in this trade and probably do not add very much in aggregate to total \u0000eet capacity. There are several possible ways for Kazakhstan to avoid a tanker capacity crunch as trans-Caspian shipments grow: (1) buy new tankers from foreign suppliers; (2) build the necessary additional vessels in Kazakhstan; or (3) rely more on the \u0000eet of Azerbaijan. Some combination of these options may eventually prove suﬃcient, but each of them involves signi\u0000cant trade-oﬀs: ► Purchase"}

KMTF has emphasized the importance of \u0000rm commitments from would-be shippers to send larger volumes across the Caspian prior to \u0000eet expansion. KMTF is not expected to undertake further \u0000eet expansion without new long-term trans-Caspian shipment contracts.³⁴ ► Construction within Kazakhstan of new tankers would require setting up an entirely new manufacturing industry. This major investment in new manufacturing facilities is a potentially promising longer-term solution. Not surprisingly, the Energy Ministry has been a leading advocate of the domestic manufacturing option, at a proposed new plant that would produce oil tankers and other vessels, but Kazakh authorities have yet to commit to a timetable or specify \u0000nancing arrangements and other key details. ► Increased reliance on Azerbaijan's eet for Aktau-Baku shipments. The resumption of Kazakh shipments via BTC has so far reportedly involved deployment of both Azerbaijan- and Kazak h-\u0000agged vessels, more or less on a parity basis. Azerbaijan, which has the largest \u0000eet of any of the Caspian littoral states, may well be able to deploy more vessels going forward, but this could leave Kazakhstan inordinately dependent on for eign-\u0000agged vessels.³⁵ The main vehicle in the near term for additional expansion of KMTF's Caspian shipping capacity—and tackling Kazakhstan's Caspian logistics challenges more broadly—may be the partner- ship between KMTF and AD Ports (which is owned by the UAE state-owned ADQ Abu Dhabi Holding Company). In December 2022, these two entities entered into an agreement to form their current JV, known as Caspian Integrated Maritime Solutions (CIMS), aimed at delivering oﬀshore and shipping services for energy companies active in the Caspian Sea (with a 51% stake for AD Ports and 49% interest for KMTF). Registered in February 2023, CIMS has plans to submit bids for various projects with estimated contract values of over $780 million, and the compa- nies have also signed a seven-year vessel pooling agreement, with the aim of jointly transporting 8-10 MMt/y (160,000-200,000 b/d) of crude oil in the medium term. During March 2023 negotiations, the partners focused on the issue of expansion of the CIMS tanker \u0000eet, to transport oil in both the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea.³⁶ KMTF has apparently ruled out Russia as a source for future tanker purchases; in a 2022 interview, the executive director of KMTF, Aydar Orzhanov, stated that KMTF was unable to purchase tankers from Russian shipowners due to sanctions.³⁷ KMTF has a strong incentive to avoid any transactions that risk running afoul of sanctions regimes since KMTF has an interna- tional business extending well beyond Caspian waters; e.g., KMTF's 2022 business plan called for only about 0.5 MMt (10,000 b/d) of Caspian Sea oil shipments, compared with 7-8 MMt (140,000-160,000 b/d) of oil shipments elsewhere. But other Kazakh companies with less international business exposure than KMTF may have fewer qualms about buying Russian- manufactured tankers. In February 2023, it was reported that a private sector Kazakh company had purchased three tankers in the river-sea category from Russia's Volga Shipping Company, for crude and product loadings at Aktau.³⁸ 34 KMTF will nevertheless likely need to acquire new tankers in coming years to replace ageing vessels in its existing \u0000eet, the average age of which is over 18 years.35 KURSIV, Energy Ministry wants Kazakhstan to produce oil tankers, 4 April 2023, https://kz.kursiv.media/en/2023-04-04/minis try-of-energy-wants-kazakhstan- to-produce-oil-tankers/. 36 S&P Global Commodity Insights, Energy Technical Report, KazMunayGaz and Abu Dhabi Ports JV to purchase additional tankers, April 2023. 37 SK NEWS, Glava Kazmortransota – o nefteperevozkakh v usloviyakh sanktsionnoy voyny, 24 May 2022, https://sknews.kz/news/view/glava-kazmortransﬂot-o- nefteperevozkah-v-usloviyah-sankcionnoy-voyny. 38 Argus News & analysis, KMG to supply Tengiz for BTC, 24 February 2023, https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2423350.KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR 131 Kazakhstan's marine terminals: Another potential bottleneck The aggregate nameplate capacity of Kazakhstan's two existing Caspian oil terminals, Aktau and Kuryk, is estimated at around 12 MMt/y (240,000 b/d), indicating an aggregate utilization rate in 2022 of only about 10%. But there are reports of railroad constraints leading to the ports, and signi \u0000cant dredging operations are required at both of them before would-be shippers can make full use of the terminal facilities. Oil shipments via Aktau reached a maximum of 9.6 MMt (192,000 b/d) in 2006, but since 2010 have been well below this level, and in February 2023 the Energy Ministry estimated Aktau's crude loading capacity in the range of 5.5-7.5 MMt/y (110,000 b/d-150,000 b/d), while Kuryk's actual capacity (for ferries rather than tankers) is considerably less. In short, these terminals' existing oil loading facilities can accommodate some increase in trans-Caspian shipments above recent levels, but their limited operable capacity puts a ceiling on potential shipments in the medium term well below the amounts being targeted by Kazakh oﬃcials. At the same time, Aktau and Kuryk terminal authorities have ambitious infrastructure expansion plans, if suﬃcient investment can be found: ► Aktau. Built in 1963, the Aktau International Commercial Sea Port is owned since 2013 by Kazakhstan T emir Zholy (KTZ), the national railway company. The port is accessible to oil producers by rail and by pipeline. A pipeline operated by KTO carries crude south from producers on the Buzachi and Mangyshlak peninsulas, while crude coming from other directions reaches Aktau by rail.³⁹ KMTF and other entities lease berths at Aktau (e.g., three berths are leased to KMTF under a 49-year lease). In 2022, only two out of the four terminals at the port loaded oil. Current Aktau capacity expansion initiatives include reconstruction of berths 9 and 10; these were deactivated eight years ago, but are now being put back into operation, though their utilization also reportedly depends on replacement by KTO of a pipeline segment. Altogether, the measures currently under way or under consideration, including improvements in operational eﬃciencies, could boost oil shipment capacity of Aktau to 17 MMt/y (340,000 b/d) according to Aktau management.⁴⁰ ► Kuryk . Located 70 km south of Aktau, and commissioned in 2017, Port Kuryk can handle oil and products via rail ferry. Although smaller than Aktau, Kuryk is a shorter tanker journey time to Baku,"}

There are plans to increase Kuryk's capacity to as much as 20 MMt/y (400,000 b/d). A pre-FEED study is currently under way, encompassing oil storage and loading along with other facilities, while development costs have been estimated at $50 million by port developer Semurg Invest.⁴¹5.5 Rening and Rened Product Market Dynamics 5.5.1 Recent evolution of Kazakhstan's rened product balance In 2022, r e\u0000nery throughput in Kazakhstan rose by 5.2% to 17.9 MMt, driven by an underlying rise in domestic product demand: apparent consumption of r e\u0000ned products also rose by 5.2% to 15.9 MMt; aggregate product exports rose by 3.7% to 2.6 MMt, while imports dropped by 0.8% to 0.7 MMt (see Table 5.7 Kazakhstan's r e\u0000ned product balance). The 2022 r e\u0000nery throughput was a record volume, surpassing the pre-pandemic level (2019 throughput amounted to 17.0 MMt). R e\u0000nery output of all the primary products increased for the second year in a row in 2022. Apparent consumption of re\u0000ned products in 2022 was the highest since independence. Growth continued to be concentrated in motor fuels—diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel. But mazut exports, essentially a r e\u0000nery byproduct, also rose strongly in 2022; it accounted for 90% of Kazakhstan's total r e\u0000ned product exports.⁴² Kazakhstan likely faces an increased requirement for imports of selected re \u0000ned products overall in 2023—given buoyant product demand coupled with more r e\u0000nery maintenance and unplanned July 2023 stoppages at two major plants that look likely to keep r e\u0000nery throughput fairly sluggish. Kazakhstan's total 2023 product import needs (announced by the Energy Ministry in February 2023) already was expected to be 700,000 tons of diesel and 300,000 tons of jet fuel imports (compared with diesel and kerosene imports in 2022 of around 200,000 tons and 100,000 tons, respectively). Kazakh r e\u0000ned product balance dynamics during January-June point to overall market tightness for these two middle distillate products (see Table 5.8 Key trends for Kazakhstan's main r e\u0000ned products in the \u0000rst six months of 2023).⁴³³⁷ 39 There is a peculiarity in the rail route which increases the costs of railing crude to Aktau. While KTZ owns and operates Kazakhstan's rail system, the last 17 km of rail into Aktau is owned by a private-sector Kazakh entity, Kazkortransservis; the company has charged a signi\u0000cantly higher tariﬀ (per ton-km) on this segment of the route than KTZ charges on its general shipments. 40 Kaspiyskiy vestnik, Port Aktau ne mozhet perevalit ves obyom nefti, 3 May 2023, http://casp-geo.ru/port-aktau-ne-mozhet-perevalit-ves-obem-nefti/.41 S&P Global Commodity Insights, Platts Oilgram News, INTERVIEW: Kazakh port developer Semurg Invest oﬀers 'Plan B' for country's crude exports, April 2023. 42 The United Arab Emirates overtook the Netherlands as the primary destination of for Kazakh mazut exports in 2022, importing 1.0 MMt. 43 Another product in relatively short supply domestically is bitumen; in his September 2022 State of the Nation address, President T okayev drew attention to the need to overcome a national bitumen de\u0000cit, and in July 2023 Kazakhstan reached an agreement with Russia to triple annual imports of road bitumen (to 300,000 tons per year).

Shymkent, which is now the biggest r e\u0000ner, increased throughput by 20.2% to 6.2 MMt in 2022, and was the primary producer of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel in Kazakhstan in 2022. Pavlodar also raised throughput in 2022, but by only 1.4% to 5.5 MMt, while Atyrau's throughput contracted by 4.6% to 5.2 MMt; Atyrau produces the largest volume of mazut among Kazakhstan's re\u0000neries (see Table 5.9 Output of primary r e\u0000ned products by major Kazakh r e\u0000neries). Although domestic markets remained generally well supplied by re\u0000ners in 2022, periodic shortages still occurred for certain products and regional markets; maintenance at the Shymkent and Atyrau plants was rescheduled to avoid this and meet burgeoning domestic demand. All three of the larger r e\u0000neries were slated for scheduled maintenance over the course of 2023, with expected tightness in some product markets exacerbated by unplanned outages. In particular, during part of July, national r e\u0000nery throughput fell by nearly half due to planned and unscheduled stoppages at the major plants.⁴⁴ Aggregate annual nameplate distillation capacity of the three major r e\u0000neries currently amounts to 17.5 MMt—6.0 MMt at Shymkent and Pavlodar, and 5.5 MMt at Atyrau. But all routinely have run above capacity during some months each year. The eﬀective capacity is over 6.5 MMt/y for both Shymkent and Pavlodar, while Atyrau has routinely run over 450,000 tons/month, and up to 500-510,000 tons/month, implying an eﬀective capacity of nearly 6 MMt/y. All three plants are intent on expanding and/or or upgrading existing distillation capacity. Kazakh authorities' plans for expansion of national r e\u0000ning capacity center on Shymkent, given the concentration of domestic demand growth in southern Kazakhstan, and in May 2023 President T okayev announced that Shymkent's capacity will be doubled, to 12 MMt/y. The government is also intent on further boosting diesel yield at Pavlodar: a joint venture between KMG and France's Air Liquide plans to build a hydrogen unit at the Pavlodar plant with the aim of producing 160,000 tons per year of winter diesel, and this project underscores how important it is for Kazakhstan not to be dependent on (Russian) imports of diesel—notwithstanding the EAEU integration process and even though it may be more expensive to manufacture additional diesel locally than to import the product from Russia. With respect to the Atyrau r e\u0000nery, priorities include expansion of plant capacity by 1.2 MMt/y and development of power generation; Kazakh authorities called for acceleration of plans to build a gas turbine plant after the July 2023 power disruption. Both Pavlodar and Atyrau are currently relatively well supplied with KMG-produced crude, although Pavlodar receives this as Russian crude that is delivered to the plant under a Rosneft- CNPC swap arrangement whereby KMG delivers an equivalent volume of Kazakh crude to CNPC via the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline.⁴⁵ The bulk of crude processed at the Shymkent r e\u0000nery comes from non-KMG assets, mainly JVs and independent producers in Aktobe and Kyzylorda oblasts; the r e\u0000nery's single largest supplier in recent years has been CNPC- AktobeMunayGaz, accounting for around a third of the plant's total crude supplies in 2022 (see Figure 5.12 Crude oil deliveries to major Kazakh r e\u0000neries by producer in 2022).Table 5.9 Output of primary reﬁned products by the major Kazakh reﬁneries (MМt) 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Percent change 2021-22 Shymkent Crude throughput Motor gasoline Diesel Jet fuel Mazut Pavlodar Crude throughput Motor gasoline Diesel Jet fuel Mazut Atyrau Crude throughput Motor gasoline Diesel Jet fuel Mazut4.8 1.3 1.2 0.3 0.8 5.3 1.4 1.7 0.1 0.6 5.3 1.2 1.5 0.0 1.15.4 1.9 1.5 0.3 0.7 5.3 1.4 1.8 0.2 0.6 5.4 1.2 1.5 0.1 1.24.8 2.0 1.4 0.2 0.3 5.0 1.4 1.6 0.1 0.5 5.0 1.1 1.5 0.1 1.15.2 1.9 1.6 0.3 0.6 5.4 1.5 1.7 0.2 0.6 5.5 1.4 1.6 0.1 1.26.2 2.1 1.9 0.3 1.0 5.5 1.6 1.8 0.2 0.6 5.2 1.3 1.5 0.1 1.220.2 10.5 24.3 15.8 60.7 1.4 4.4 5.2 11.9 7.2 -4.6 -7.4 -5.9 10.1 1.7 Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights, KMG. © 2023 S&P Global. 44 See Kazakhstan Newsline, Oil rening in Kazakhstan decreases by almost half, 10 July 2023, https://newsline.kz/article/1123478/; Kazakhstan Newsline, Shymkent renery in Kazakhstan ready to operate as usual, 19 July 2023, https://newsline.kz/article/1124675/. 45 Located near Kazakhstan's northeastern border with Russia, the Pavlodar re\u0000nery sources its crude from Russia because of the relative logistics. Producers in western and south-central Kazakhstan send volumes (nominally) to the Pavlodar r e\u0000nery as part of the swap arrangement with Rosneft on that company's exports to China; i.e., Kazakh crude recorded as deliveries to Pavlodar physically is directed to China within the framework of the Rosneft- CNPC swap deal, and the Pavlodar r e\u0000nery processes Russian crude. Kazakh producers are still responsible for covering the hypothetical costs for transportation to Pavlodar rather than to Alashankou. KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR 134 5.5.2.1 Feedstock supply issues Each major plant faces feedstock supply risks during the outlook period, given the ongoing decline of legacy crude production at \u0000elds that have traditionally supplied them. This ultimately translates into a crude supply challenge for Kazakh policymakers since it is the Energy Ministry that determines the schedule for crude supplies to r e\u0000neries under the current system. Shymkent appears particularly vulnerable, as it does not have a readily available alternative crude supply source to replace its traditional sources, while at the same time Shymkent is also the r e\u0000nery that is most “exposed” to the concerns of independent"}

Their crude deliveries to the r e\u0000nery (at reduced domestic prices) can involve relatively high transportation costs (some crude deliveries to Shymkent must be shipped as much as 2,000 km, incurring transportation costs on the order of $24/ton from Atyrau). The relatively great dependence of Shymkent on independents for feedstock supply also leaves the plant especially vulnerable to negative knock-on eﬀects of arti \u0000cially-low domestic prices on suppliers; i.e., whereas KMG may in theory oﬀset losses on domestic sales with revenue from its higher- priced export streams, the independents traditionally have less access to export markets, with the result that they are more likely to cut back upstream spending and ultimately domestic deliveries if domestic prices fail to cover costs and provide a return on investment. All three plants still operate on a tolling basis that serves as means to \u0000nance the $6 billion modernization program during 2014-18, but tolling may not be optimal longer term given the r e\u0000neries' crude supply needs. Under the tolling system, crude suppliers pay re\u0000ners a fee to process the crude, and retain title to the resulting re\u0000ned products for subsequent sale. The processing tariﬀs for the three major r e\u0000neries are established by KMG for the Atyrau and Pavlodar plants, and by the board of directors of PetroKazakhstan for Shymkent. In 2022, the processing tariﬀ reached $91.7/ton for Atyrau, $50.1/ton for Pavlodar, and $76.2/ton for Shymkent. KMG's outlook is for tariﬀs for all three re\u0000neries to remain \u0000at (in tenge terms) through 2026. Kazakh re\u0000ners have little incentive to alter the current tolling scheme over the next decade or so as they pay back sizable loans for their previous modernizations. The tolling system tends to insulate re\u0000ners from market forces, with the result that plants may lack incentive to improve eﬃciencies further. So as the loans are paid oﬀ, there is growing reason for Kazakhstan to consider a more market-oriented business model whereby r e\u0000ners function as merchant operators who buy crude oil feedstock and sell \u0000nished re\u0000ned products (as in other EAEU states and most of the rest of the world).⁴⁶ 5.5.3 Outlook for Kazakhstan's rened product balance Our base-case scenario is for an ongoing rise in re \u0000nery throughput out to 2050, lifting the total by around 24% to 22.3 MMt, in order to meet most of a continued expansion in domestic apparent r e\u0000ned product demand (projected to be about 43.0% higher at 22.8 MMt—much of it concentrated in diesel (see Figure 5.13 Outlook for apparent consumption of r e\u0000ned products in Kazakhstan). The base case has Kazakhstan becoming a net importer of r e\u0000ned products by 2045, with net imports of about 0.5 MMt in 2050; imports consist mainly of diesel during 2023-50, while during the outlook period Kazakhstan also increases exports of certain products, notably gasoline. We expect the transportation segment in particular to be a major incremental consumer of r e\u0000ned products longer term, as diesel-engine vehicles as well as vehicles with engines that run on gasoline (and LPGs) will continue to dominate the \u0000eet. One key implication is that signi\u0000cant expansion of existing re\u0000ning capacity is needed. Regionally, the pattern of product demand growth indicates that a sizable expansion of annual throughput capacity at Shymkent for crude distillation—by 3 MMt to 9 MMt—is required during the period (late 2020s or early 2030s). Meanwhile, only minor “capacity creep” is needed at Pavlodar and Atyrau, through selective debottlenecking and improvement of operational eﬃciencies. As noted above, the Kazakh government envisions a larger-scale expansion of annual Figure 5.12 Crude oil deliveries to major Kazakh reﬁneries by producer in 2022 (MМt) Notes: *KMG JV; **KMG fully-owned subsidiary .

KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR 135 Shymkent capacity in the medium term—by 6 MMt to 12 MMt. In either scenario, however, southern Kazakhstan product demand growth may exceed regional product supply. We expect southern Kazakhstan will continue to have a regional de\u0000cit of products overall, but the gap can be met with surplus products from other regions/plants (mainly Atyrau), while a net de\u0000cit of products is expected to emerge in north-central Kazakhstan as well. Southern Kazakhstan and north-central Kazakhstan experience de\u0000cits of gasoline and diesel (relative to regional production) during most of the outlook period. In parallel with overall capacity expansion, further improvements are needed in the quality of selected products. With r e\u0000nery modernization, Kazakh r e\u0000neries already mainly produce fuel with K-4 (Euro-4) and K-5 (Euro-5) speci\u0000cations, but all motor fuel should eventually meet K-5 standards, resulting in a reduction in sulfur emissions from the K-4 level of 50 parts per million (ppm) to 10 ppm. 5.5.4 Sensitivity of the domestic demand trajectory to the progress of market reforms The above-noted base case for domestic consumption assumes continued liberalization of domestic crude and product prices, with the result that average price levels reach netback parity by around 2030. This means crude producers in Kazakhstan are incentivized to deliver suﬃcient feedstock supplies to Kazakhstan's r e\u0000neries at export-parity prices, and r e\u0000ners have suﬃcient incentive to direct the bulk of their products to domestic markets (while directing some surplus to export markets). But this outcome is by no means guaranteed, and in the absence of such price reform, domestic product demand will likely be higher than in the base case. Price regulation is not only a problem for Kazakh crude producers (who in eﬀect subsidize ar ti\u0000cially low consumer prices at the pump through crude oil sales at prices well below world market levels), and for r e\u0000ned product market players in Kazakhstan (given the extremely limited retail markup). As noted in Chapter 3, the resulting market distortions"}

But all domestic motor fuel prices have since remained heavily administered in Kazakhstan notwithstanding oﬃcial price liberalization. Meanwhile, the average domestic price for crude oil is typically even lower than average domestic product prices in relation to comparable international benchmarks. In 2022, the average domestic crude oil price received by producers amounted to only around 32% of the level of the average price for Kazakhstan's primary oil export stream—down from 37% in 2021 (see Figure 5.14 Comparison of domestic Kazakh and international crude oil prices). Domestic deliveries nevertheless still tend to generate positive margins, due largely to lower transportation costs (relative to exports) and a lower MRET rate. The January 2022 events temporarily reversed the prior impetus for higher domestic prices through liberalization; in the wake of the mass protests, the government decreed a freeze on gasoline and diesel as well as LPG prices. In January 2023, the government decreed a prolongation of state regulation of motor fuel prices inde\u0000nitely, although Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov also stated that his government was committed to the gradual transition to market-based regulation of r e\u0000ned product prices. Subsequently, Kazakh authorities have begun raising the ceiling on gasoline and diesel prices, and in August 2022 instituted a two- tiered retail diesel price system whereby foreign citizens are required to pay higher prices for diesel than Kazakh citizens—in an eﬀort to combat the chronic problem of cross-border “leakage” and “grey” market sales.Figure 5.13 Outlook for apparent consumption of reﬁned products in Kazakhstan (MМt) Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global.152025 Diesel fuel Gasoline Mazut Other 0510 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050 47 The price diﬀerentials incentivize the redirection of Kazakh motor fuels to consumers in neighboring states in a variety of forms, including personal use, resale, and transit. Anecdotal evidence suggests signi\u0000cant “grey” exports in both diesel (for trucking) and gasoline (by cars) in recent years. For example, S&P Global estimates that in addition to ~150,000 tons per year of diesel that are used for legitimate transit, another ~150,000-200,000 tons are likely involved in the “grey” export trade in Kazakhstan.KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR 136 Figure 5.14 Comparison of domestic Kazakh and international crude oil prices Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights, KAZENERGY. © 2023 S&P Global.5159 3943 384658 37 40506070 6080100120Average domestic price as percent of average export price (right axis) 32 0102030 02040$/bbl % 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022Average domestic price for crude oil received by producers Average export price for crude oil (CPC Blend, MED CIF) ► The imperatives of EAEU oil market integration. The pending launch of the EAEU common market in oil and oil products in 2025 means that it will be diﬃcult for Kazakhstan to continue to resist the pull of market forces, and its domestic prices will eventually be pushed or pulled into parity with its neighbors (see Chapter 3). Russia is the largest EAEU producer, consumer, and exporter of r e\u0000ned products and Russian market dynamics will therefore likely play a decisive role in determining overall EAEU market outcomes. Russia's product prices are generally based on export parity; its export duty and transportation costs act as wedge between domestic prices and export prices, but the Russian export tax is being phased out by 2024 as part of wider \u0000scal reform. ► The tightening of Kazakhstan's crude oil balance as aggregate production begins to decline while domestic demand continues to rise. One of the most critical drivers of domestic price liberalization is the expected tightening supply of crude oil after 2025. As noted above, Kazakh oil produc- tion is expected to reach a maximum in about 2025 and then begin to decline, but domestic crude oil demand remains on an upward trajectory, given rising domestic product consumption. Moreover, the production decline is likely to be initially concentrated in various legacy KMG \u0000elds that have traditionally been a mainstay of Kazakh r e\u0000nery feedstock supply. Along with removal of price controls, additional reforms of crude oil and product market structures could go far to ensure that domestic product demand is adequately supplied by Kazakh re\u0000ners during the outlook period. Under the current system, subsoil users sell crude oil for the domestic market (domestic re\u0000neries) via direct contracts with crude supplier-traders; there is currently no centralized exchange in place. The crude supplier- traders (in Russian, davaltsy ), in turn, obtain r e\u0000ned products through the above-noted tolling arrangements, and their remuneration comes when they sell the basket of petroleum products they receive from the r e\u0000nery for the crude they supply—to retailers and secondary wholesalers at ex-r e\u0000nery As noted above (see Chapter 3), in April 2023 the government raised the maximum allowable AI-92 retail gasoline price (to 205 tenge or around $0.45) per liter. During the same month the government decreed a continuation of the overall diﬀerentiation of retail diesel prices instituted previously and simultaneously raised the maximum allowable diesel price for Kazakh citizens within this system. Speci\u0000cally, the April 2023 decree established the following retail diesel price parameters: ► Kazakh citizens⁴⁸: 295 tenge ($0.65) per liter, up to speci\u0000ed volumes, depending on the vehicle type; i.e., up to 100 liters per day in the case of light vehicles, and up to 300 liters per day for trucks, buses, and other specialized automobiles. ► Foreign citizens, as well as Kazakh citizens in the case of diesel purchases in quantities that exceed the above-noted limits: 450 ($1) tenge per liter.

Policymakers have signaled their commitment in principle to more far-reaching motor fuel price reforms. For example, in June 2023 a proposal to tie gasoline prices in Kazakhstan to world price quotes for oil and/or r e\u0000ned products was announced by Kuat Asambekov, the deputy director of the Fuel and Energy Complex of the Agency for the Protection and Development of Competition. But no schedule for price changes has yet been indicated, while Asambekov has emphasized that any such reform would be implemented in diﬀerent phases.⁴⁹ T wo key developments expected during the mid-2020s are nevertheless likely to compel policymakers to undertake further liberalization of domestic oil prices: 48 T echnically, the decree limits diesel sales at the discounted prices to holders of a Kazakh driver's license or cer ti\u0000cates of vehicle registration in Kazakhstan, but in practice this basically means Kazakh citizens. 49 LS, V Kazakhstanye predlagayut privyazat tseny na GSV k nefti, 22 June 2023, https://lsm.kz/v-kazahstane-predlagayut-ceny-na-gsm.KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR 137 wholesale prices. The crude supplier-trader is the middleman and appears to add little if any value compared with other key players in the value chain. Seeking to reduce the number of unnecessary market partici- pants, the Energy Ministry and the Agency for Protection and Development of Competition have considered reforms that would exclude intermediaries from operating in the r e\u0000ned product distribution segment if they: (1) lack ownership rights to oil production/processing/sale of petroleum products or (2) lack ownership of oil depots or \u0000lling stations. T o date these proposals remain on paper, but there are signs that Kazakhstan's main re\u0000neries are looking to reduce the role of intermediaries. Speci\u0000cally, in April 2023 the Energy Ministry reported that the Atyrau r e\u0000nery had begun to reverse an earlier outsourcing process, with the result that plant management has begun to assume responsibility for a wide range of activity along the value chain that had previously been delegated to intermediaries, including service and repair shop activities, railway operations, and freight shipments; the Pavlodar and Shymkent plants have reportedly undertaken similar measures.⁵⁰ Exchange trading of re\u0000ned products is also slated to increase, which should further reduce the role of these intermediaries; the Energy Ministry has estimated that the share of exchange trading in petroleum products in Kazakhstan will gradually rise from around 10% of output in December 2022 to 15-20% during 2023-24. Notwithstanding such positive signs, the risk remains that pricing and market reforms will not proceed quickly enough to incentivize the needed changes. In an alternative pricing scenario, where domestic prices remain depressed below market parity, domestic demand rises more robustly and there are more cross-border \u0000ows and higher transit-related fuel consumption. In this scenario, Kazakh policymakers continue to rely on the current mix of administrative measures to control the domestic r e\u0000ned product market. Meeting a higher level of aggregate product demand also means more r e\u0000nery expansion and more r e\u0000nery upgrades than assumed in our current base case, and poses more of a dilemma in securing crude supply for the r e\u0000neries. 5.5.5 Key dynamics for selected rened products This section looks in more detail at major r e\u0000ned product balance trends for the main r e\u0000ned products consumed in Kazakhstan, starting with diesel fuel and kerosene—two key products that have been in relatively short supply domestically in recent years—followed by discussion of gasoline and mazut balance dynamics. 5.5.5.1 Diesel Diesel is the single largest component (product) in Kazakhstan's re\u0000nery slate and in its domestic consumption balance. Widely consumed in Kazakhstan, diesel is used across many economic sectors, while the transportation sector (trucking) is the single largest consumer. In their role as distributors, Petrosun and KMG are the key suppliers of diesel fuel to the domestic market. Demand is mostly met with domestic production, but Kazakhstan remained a net importer of relatively small diesel volumes each year during 2016-22. In 2022, diesel output increased by 8.5% to 5.4 MMt; there was a 7.2% rise in apparent demand to 5.5 MMt, while imports fell by 47.4% to 178,000 tons, and exports declined by 46.7% to 119,000 tons (see Figure 5.15 Kazakhstan's diesel balance, 2015-22). The 2022 jump in domestic diesel demand probably r e\u0000ected a combination of further pandemic recovery, higher underlying economic growth, as well as extra cross-border traﬃc. Demand has also been supported by growing cargo traﬃc through Kazakhstan. During the \u0000rst part of 2023 Kazakh r e\u0000nery output of diesel continued to fall short of domestic demand; in January- June 2023, diesel output rose by only 2.7% to 2.8 MMt, but domestic consumption surged by 10.3% to 3.0 MMt; imports increased several-fold in the \u0000rst six months to 232,000 tons, while exports rose by 18.4% to 53,000 tons. In the S&P Global base case, diesel output increases quite strongly during 2023-50, rising by 90% to 10.3 MMt in 2050; consumption, though, increases by 126% to 12.3 MMt. Imports become increasingly necessary during the outlook period, with net diesel imports reaching 2.1 MMt in 2050. We expect trucking (including transit)−tied to underlying GDP growth and the need to move goods−to drive the bulk of the rise in domestic diesel demand. Other segments of demand (e.g., agriculture, industry) grow more slowly. 5.5.5.2 Kerosene Traditionally a net importer of kerosene (mostly jet), Kazakhstan has approached self-suﬃciency at times following re \u0000nery modernization; domestic production satis \u0000ed over 85% of consumption in 2022, up from less than 60% in 2016. Jet kero is consumed in the civil and military aviation segments, and demand has expanded rapidly since 2015 with the proliferation of tourism and expansion of air travel in Kazakhstan—growing by an annual average of about 10% during 2016-22 (even after factoring in the nearly 30% drop in 2020). Regionally, demand is concentrated in southern Kazakhstan (where the Almaty hub is a key demand center). The Energy Ministry and the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructural"}

Based on Kazakhstan's Bureau of Statistics data, total kerosene (mostly jet) production in Kazakhstan rose by 14.7% in 2022 to reach a new historical maximum of 673,000 tons, while apparent demand jumped by 19.6% and also reached a new record level, of 762,000 tons; imports rose by 56.7% to 101,000 tons, while exports remained negligible at 12,000 tons (see Figure 5.16 Kazakhstan's kerosene balance, 2015-22). Kazakhstan's imports of kerosene will be even higher in 2023, as production has failed to match increases in consumption. But Kazakh authorities actually banned the import of jet kero from Russia during part of the summer, claiming that an oversupply had resulted in overstocking risks and a reduction of Kazakh r e\u0000nery output of the product. During January-June 2023, jet kero output contracted by 17.1% to 299,000 tons while consumption rose 12.0% to 463,000 tons; imports jumped 340.7% to 144,000 tons. Precise data are lacking on the breakdown of Kazakhstan's jet fuel production among diﬀerent grades recently, but the ambition is to expand production of Jet A-1 fuel grade, aimed at serving the higher number of international \u0000ights and boosting Kazakhstan's 50 LS, V Kazakhstanye nashli sposob izbavit NPZ ot posrednikov, 5 April 2023, https://lsm.kz/v-kazahstane-pridumali-kak-izbavit-npz-ot-posrednikov.KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR 138 role as a Central Asian transit hub. Western sanctions have largely deprived Russia of its traditional role as a transit corridor and hub for \u0000ights between Europe and Asia, and Kazakhstan aims to \u0000ll this role, but faces competition from other Central Asian states and Turkey. One of the factors international airlines look at in setting up their routes is the availability of Jet A-1—the standard jet fuel in most of the world. TS-1, the most common jet fuel grade currently used in Kazakhstan (and within the former Soviet Union generally), is approved by the majority of aircraft manufac- turers, but is slightly more volatile than Jet A-1 due to its lower \u0000ash point.⁵¹ A superior grade of jet fuel, the premium RT product, has been manufactured since 2018 by Kazakhstan's Pavlodar r e\u0000nery, which does not produce the TS-1 grade. In our base-case outlook, kerosene production grows by 79% over 2023-50 to reach 1.2 MMt/y. Domestic supply is expected to meet domestic demand again by the late 2020s, but Kazakhstan will likely shift back to being a slight net importer of kerosene, l:argely from Russia, starting in the 2030s. But imports are expected to remain modest. Kazakh r e\u0000nery expansion and upgrades, along with domestic reforms of the jet fuel market, will be instrumental in minimizing dependence on imports and the security risk that entails during the outlook period ► The Shymkent renery is expected to provide the biggest increase in jet fuel output following its planned expansion and further modernization. Shymkent will nearly triple production of jet fuel, to around 1 MMt/y by 2030, according to KMG's ambitious expansion plan. If so, then domestic re\u0000ners will be able to completely cover all of Kazakhstan's aviation needs. ► Greater reliance on market forces via exchange trading would help eliminate chronic product shortages.

Only a small share of jet fuel is traded on exchanges (around 10% of the total) and plays no role in domestic price formation; exchange prices tend to be below average wholesale prices, which are in turn typically lower than import prices.⁵² 5.5.5.3 Gasoline Gasoline is the second largest r e\u0000ned product by output and consumption in Kazakhstan. Shymkent is Kazakhstan's largest producer of gasoline. Each r e\u0000nery dominates supply in a diﬀerent region of the country. Petrosun and KMG together delivered over 80% of AI-92 and most AI-95 gasoline to the domestic market at last report; relatively little is marketed through commodity exchanges (the oﬃcial target for commodity exchange sales of gasoline was only 10% of the total earlier this year, though the share of gasoline sold on exchanges is supposed to rise to 20% by 2025). Gasoline production rose by 3.1% in 2022 to 4.97 MMt—nearly equivalent to domestic demand, which increased by 5.7% to 4.99 MMt. The rebound in domestic consumption squeezed exports, which declined by 76% to 20,000 tons, while imports rose several- fold to 43,000 tons—making Kazakhstan a small net importer of gasoline again in 2022 for the \u0000rst time since 2018 (see Figure 5.17 Kazakhstan's gasoline balance, 2015-22). During the \u0000rst six months of 2023, production and consumption of motor gasoline both rose by around 5% to 2.6 MMt. In our base case, domestic gasoline production expands by 50%, to 7.5 MMt in 2050. Apparent demand rises by 23.0%, to 6.1 MMt. As a result, export volumes are expected to grow several-fold; net exports reach 1.3 MMt in 2050. Longer term, higher private car ownership (stemming from higher personal incomes and GDP growth) drives overall gasoline demand. There is only limited development through 2050 of alternatives to gasoline -\u0000red vehicles (such as electric cars, CNG/LNG, etc.), but one key factor limiting the upside to gasoline demand is increasing fuel eﬃciencies in engines.5.5.5.4 Mazut Mazut is a relatively low value heavy product that has traditionally been in surplus domestically and therefore exported in large volumes. Domestically, mazut is primarily consumed in the power/heating sector and agriculture, and domestic prices are regulated for socially important consumers.

With respect to exports, mazut is typically used as an intermediary feedstock in more sophisticated r e\u0000neries (often in Europe) as well as a bunker fuel in ships. Mazut output and exports both contracted starting in 2018 as a result of re \u0000nery modernization, but production remains signi\u0000cant; in 2022, higher r e\u0000nery runs drove output up by 18% to 3.3 MMt (the highest level since 2017). So although apparent demand was also up, to 0.9 MMt (the most since 2010), exports rose to 2.4 MMt (see Figure 5.18 Kazakhstan's mazut balance, 2015-22). It seems that given r e\u0000nery con\u0000gurations, r e\u0000neries may have been compelled to produce more surplus mazut as a byproduct as they ramped up manufacture of the lighter products in higher demand. During the \u0000rst six months of 2023 the mazut production and consumption trends reversed, as Kazakhstan relied more on imports of selected light products (diesel and kerosene) to meet surging domestic demand, reducing the need to manufacture heavy byproducts; output of mazut fell by 5.5% to 1.6 MMt in January-June 2023 and domestic demand dropped 55.1% to 271,000 tons; even so, exports rose by 23.2% to 1.3 MMt.Figure 5.17 Kazakhstan's gasoline balance, 2015-22 (MМt) Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global.-2-10123456 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022Production Exports Imports Consumption (apparent) Net exportsKAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR 51 The TS-1 jet fuel grade has a minimum \u0000ash point of 28 ºC versus 38 ºC for Jet A-1. 52 Kazakhstan's centralized allocation process for distribution of jet kerosene de\u0000es global practices; most airlines or airports worldwide acquire fuel directly from the market under long-term contracts, allowing airlines to reduce costs with economies of scale.

Important steps taken by Kazakhstan in recent years to facilitate greater upstream spending and development include the online auctioning procedure for E&P blocks starting in 2020 and approval of IMC terms for designated complex projects starting in 2023. But both of these initiatives are falling short of their goals of attracting large-scale new investment; incentives on oﬀer do not compare well with those available elsewhere for global companies. Additional reforms currently on the government's drawing board stop short of addressing many of the above-ground risk issues that are limiting new upstream investment, but do include a number of promising initiatives that should be implemented in the near term—including a Subsoil Code amendment that would give producers more leeway to diverge from originally-planned project indicators without so many additional administrative procedures, and extension of the scope of the Alternative Subsoil Use Tax to include mature \u0000elds. ► Midstream: Kazakhstan's trans-Caspian oil export diversication push promises to reduce dependence on Russian routes and lower overall midstream risk, but oﬃcial trans- Caspian shipment targets will probably need to be scaled back given infrastructure constraints and high transportation costs. Key potential advantages of the trans-Caspian route include ample spare capacity in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and access to broader global markets. In contrast, the chief other export route for Kazakhstan bypassing Russian territory—the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline—cannot access multiple world markets. But the government's aspirational target of a massive (several-fold) increase in trans-Caspian oil export volumes seems overly ambitious. Midstream players would likely be reluctant to commit to the major additional expenditures that would be required, such as \u0000eet and terminal expansion and other infrastructure—especially in the absence of larger throughput commitments by crude shippers. It also remains unclear how much div ersi\u0000cation is actually needed to reduce the overall export risk to a tolerable level. ► Downstream: Price liberalization is required along with renery expansion to ensure that the growing domestic oil market is well supplied. One of the most critical drivers of domestic price liberalization, alongside EAEU integration, is the expected tightening supply of crude oil after 2025. With the decline of legacy KMG production, r e\u0000ners will need to access alternative sources of supply. Given the right price signals, some of the necessary supplies can come from the IOCs' production streams and the smaller independent Kazakh oil producers. If domestic prices are kept ar ti\u0000cially low, Kazakh authorities will likely need to continue resorting to an imperfect array of administrative measures to direct suﬃcient crude and products to the domestic market, domestic demand will be higher than otherwise, and r e\u0000nery expansion and investment will need to be on a larger scale. There are other energy security considerations that factor in, including the need to stem “leakage” of low-priced Kazakh motor fuels to consumers in neighboring states.KAZAKHSTAN'S OIL SECTOR Longer term, mazut output is expected to contract by 73.2% to 0.9 MMt/y by 2050. Further re \u0000nery modernization and debottlenecking is expected to raise the share of light products in overall output, reducing the share of heavy products. But domestic demand for mazut is expected to decline by only 4% during the outlook period, holding at about 1 MMt, so Kazakh exports of mazut fall quite steeply. Nonetheless, Kazakh r e\u0000neries are expected to still have a signi\u0000cant surplus of mazut that will need to be exported during the outlook period, but net exports of mazut drop by 79% to 0.5 MMt in 2050. 141 6.1 Key Points ► A major national goal is to expand"}

T o accomplish this, on 31 December 2021, the Government of Kazakhstan approved the Comprehensive Plan for Kazakhstan’s Gas Industry Development for 2022–2026 and also established a new national champion for gas, JSC National Company QazaqGaz. QazaqGaz operates as a fully vertically integrated company with activities spanning the entire gas value chain, including exploration, production, transportation, and distribution. ► One aspect of this program is to expand the country’s existing gas resource base by making investment in upstream gas development attractive, and in so doing, expanding the total amount of gas being produced. Seven prospective new gas-oil and gas-condensate fields are planned to be put onstream over the next 5–7 years to provide incremental raw gas production of up to 4.2 Bcm/y by 2030. ► In order to secure the substantial incremental volumes of gas called for in the Comprehensive Plan for Kazakhstan's Gas Industry Development for 2022-2026, policymakers in government and in the national energy companies KazMunayGas and QazaqGaz focused on two policy approaches: (a) lowering the costs of exploration and production from new fields and improving the legal environment surrounding their licensing (Improved Model Contract); and (b) increasing the prices that producers will receive for gas from these new fields within a new administrative structure under the newly reorganized national gas company QazaqGaz. ►Another key goal in expanding gas supply is to make more commercial gas available by expanding gas processing capacity. But new capacity is very expensive as it has to process high-sulfur associated gas. By 2030, Kazakhstan plans to add 10 Bcm/y of new processing capacity. ► A major new direction began in Kazakhstan’s end-user pricing policy in 2022, with the introduction of more differentiated pricing by establishing three new consumer categories – large commercial consumers, crypto miners, and a socially vulnerable group. The first two consumer groups (large commercial consumers, crypto miners) are expected to pay higher prices to cover higher costs of production and imports of “new” gas. The socially protected group receives a significantly lower price. ►Additionally, at the end of 2022, the government approved amendments to the Law on Gas and Gas Supply, whereby wholesale ceiling prices for natural gas are now set for a five-year period to provide longer-term guarantees for gas market players (previously ceiling prices were set annually). Wholesale ceiling prices are set regionally as well as for entities that use natural gas to produce CNG or LNG for further sale to end-consumers. The Order of the Minister of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 246 dated 30 June 2023 approved ceiling wholesale prices in Kazakhstan’s domestic market for the commercial gas intended for subsequent sale to large commercial consumers, digital miners, or producers of electricity for digital mining activities for the period from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024. Provisions are made for the possibility of an annual increase in the range of 20-75% in the following years in order to move gas prices to economic levels. ► In 2022, Kazakhstan’s gross gas production was reported as 53.2 Bcm, slightly lower than in 2021. Commercial gas production (excluding reinjected volumes) amounted to 36.0 Bcm in 2022. Longer term, commercial gas supply is being pressed by strong domestic demand, especially as gas displaces coal in the power sector. This is because commercial gas production is likely to be constrained due to sustained reinjection needs, which will remain an important, economically effective gas utilization option for upstream operators. Commercial output will likely peak in the mid-2030s, at around 42 Bcm/y, reflecting the construction schedules of planned new gas processing capacity. ► Since independence, Kazakhstan has succeeded in creating a unified domestic gas transportation and distribution system. Yet, the gas transportation infrastructure is constrained by a high degree of deterioration and resultant low throughput capacity. QazaqGaz subsidiary Intergas Central Asia intends to modernize the gas transmission system and has developed a plan to 2030, designed to reduce the level of asset depreciation substantially. ► The further gasification of Kazakhstan’s cities and settlements remains a key strategic priority of policymakers. The country reached its previously set 2030 gasification goal of 56% nine years ahead of schedule, in 2021. An updated goal of 65% of the population to have access to pipeline gas by 2030 was recently set. The largest presently unserved regions are located in north-central and eastern Kazakhstan. The government is presently considering a variety of options to supply these regions, either with domestic or imported gas. ► In 2022, end-of-pipe gas consumption reached 19.3 Bcm, a 4% increase over 2021. Gasification was an important driver behind such robust growth in end-user demand. By 2050, S&P Global envisions national gas consumption (end-of-pipe deliveries) will reach around 33.2 Bcm. Gas use in the economy is expected to largely backfill for declining coal consumption rather than represent net additions to primary energy consumption. ► Exports to China plummeted in 2022 by 21%, mainly due to lack of commercial gas supply. Although several factors created a perfect storm for gas tightness in Kazakhstan during the winter of 2022-23, the decline is symptomatic of a larger problem. While Kazakhstan is still a net gas exporter, it is facing the threat of a natural gas shortage: its gasification program is driving up consumption while commercial gas production remains essentially flat. S&P Global expects that through domestic gas market reforms (price increases and improved E&P terms) and other policy changes (construction of GPZs and additional imports) Kazakhstan’s gas supply-demand balance will shift, resulting in a rebound in Kazakhstan’s gas exports in the late 2020s. We expect 6. NATURAL GAS SECTOR AND DEVELOPMENTS IN KAZAKHSTAN’S OVERALL GASIFICATION STRATEGY 143 that Kazakhstan will remain a net exporter until about 2040, but will continue to effectively utilize gas imports from the north and the south. ► Long-held plans to establish a major gas-based petrochemical industry in western Kazakhstan appear to now be bearing fruit. In November 2022, the first phase of the"}

Kazakhstan has an ample supply of low-cost NGLs such as ethane, propane, and butane that can be used as feedstocks for NGL-based petrochemical development. A recent program for petrochemical development envisions about $15 billion in capital expenditures to build several regional clusters, adding five major facilities by 2025. Kazakhstan has access to substantial gas-type feedstocks that can be utilized for petrochemical production. However, given the lack of commercial gas supply, S&P Global does not anticipate a prolific expansion in gas-based (methane) petrochemical development in Kazakhstan. ► Since 2015, Kazakhstan’s LPG consumption has been expanding rapidly, with demand increasing on average by 16% annually through 2021 and by 21% in 2022, driven mainly by rapid growth in demand in (vehicle) transportation. In S&P Global’s base-case outlook, Kazakhstan’s LPG production almost doubles, reaching almost 5.7 MMt by 2035 but then slowly declines thereafter to about 5.1 MMt in 2050. The petrochemical sector will be the largest incremental source of domestic demand over the outlook period. Liberalization of the LPG market has been postponed to 2025. 6.2 Introduction Since 2021, Kazakhstan’s gas sector has been a key focus for a broader transformation and general reforms. In many ways these changes are welcome and long overdue. The recent shift was driven to the fore by a tightening gas balance for the country and prospects of a looming “shortage” of gas for consumers, stemming from the previous one-sided policy of wider adoption of natural gas (“gasification”), particularly by households, without other supportive changes. A related central problem was that the basic business of delivering gas to Kazakh consumers was unprofitable for the national gas company. Historically, Kazakhstan has not been a significant consumer of natural gas, especially when compared to its regional peers. The abundance of low-cost domestically produced coal relegated gas use in the economy to a distant second place in the national energy balance. Coal still provides the majority of the country’s primary energy supply, although the share of gas has been growing. The adoption of a broad gasification strategy in late 2014 and adoption of the Paris Agreement’s carbon reduction goals in 2016 were preeminent underlying drivers in this strategy to increase gas consumption in the country. Since 2015, end-of-pipe gas consumption has increased at an annual average rate of 7%; unfortunately, commercial gas supply has increased at a more modest 3.5% per year on average. This resulting squeeze on gas supply forced a reduction in important gas exports to China, compelling the government to review its basic approach to the gas sector. Kazakhstan relies mainly on associated gas production and its subsequent processing (into commercial gas) to supply the bulk of its domestic gas needs. Essentially a by-product of oil production, associated gas output cannot be readily scaled to changes in demand; its availability is largely shaped by liquids production decisions. Reinjection needs and limited gas processing capacity, particularly for raw high-sulfur associated gas, also restrict commercial gas availability. Historically, Kazakhstan was able to effectively leverage its associated gas resource, procuring it for the domestic market at very low prices. This was often below costs for upstream producers, so gas supply was effectively being cross-subsidized through oil exports. However, rising gas consumption and ambitious plans to increase gas use in the residential as well as petrochemical, industrial, and power sectors, now underscore the need to secure additional sources of commercial gas through a different approach. T o that end, the government established a new vertically integrated national gas company, responsible for the full range of activities from gas exploration and production to transportation, exports, and processing of gas, spinning it out of the national oil company. Armed with this new mandate, QazaqGaz quickly has championed the need for significant changes in overall gas market policy and regulations. These changes focused on three key areas: ►Increasing the availability of commercial gas supplies via two means – new gas processing capacity and new resource development. ►Increasing gas sector investor attractiveness by offering incentives to develop “new” gas. These incentives include new legislation on exploration and development of gas fields, and offering higher prices for produced gas. ►Broader acceptance of the need to raise end-user prices for gas, with more differentiation of consumer categories (e.g., large industrial users and crypto miners) and securing general agreement that average prices for most consumer categories are set to increase going forward “on a measured basis.” A number of gas-related priorities are being pursued by Kazakhstan. These include expanding overall gas use in the economy, including greater gasification of the residential sector, expanding gas-based petrochemical production, and expanding the use of gas in other industries, particularly in electric power. The latter is especially critical given recent power grid reliability issues coupled with increased renewables penetration, driving the need for more flexible generation capacity. Other recognized priorities are to continue gas exports to China and to effectively use imported gas in the north and south to manage overall system needs. The challenge for Kazakhstan is that these “new” sources of gas will be more expensive no matter where they come from, with locally produced gas likely being more expensive (but also offering more energy security), while imported gas (even if it is less expensive than “new” local gas) has an energy security risk attached to it. This chapter describes in more detail the most recent developments in Kazakhstan’s gas industry and offers an outlook for the sector’s development. 144 6.3 Reserves and Exploration Kazakhstan’s ample gas reserves place the country in the top 20 gas resource holders globally (see Figure 6.1 Top 20 countries by recoverable gas reserves (proven+probable)). 1 As of 2023, Kazakhstan’s gas reserve base was reported at 3.79 trillion cubic meters (T cm). 2 Currently, S&P Global estimates Kazakhstan’s 2P gas reserves at 138 trillion cubic feet (4.0 T cm), which are predominantly concentrated in the Precaspian Basin in"}

T wo other important basins in the western part of the country—Mangyshlak-Central Caspian and North Ustyurt—possess more than 300 Bcm of recoverable reserves and have favorable exploration potential (see Table 6.1 Kazakhstan's estimated 2P gas reserves by basin in 2023). Slightly more than half of the reserves consist of associated gas (held in solution with liquid hydrocarbons in the reservoir) and the remainder is “free” gas. Almost 85% of gas reserves are found in the ten largest fields (including the “Big 3” mentioned above as well as Zhanazhol, Imashevskoye, Korolevskoye, Uzen, and Zhetybay), albeit at considerable depth (up to 5 km) and often with high sulfur content, both of which complicate field development and production and contribute to relatively high production and processing costs. In terms of operatorship, the three biggest holders of gas reserves are NCOC, KPO, and TCO (see Figure 6.2 Kazakhstan’s 2P gas reserves in 2023 by operator). The only other significant reserve holder—CNPC-AktobeMunayGas—has its most important gas reserves in the Zhanazhol field, which accounts for about 3.4% of Kazakhstan’s total. Kazakhstan’s simpler gas fields (those with shallower depths or without sulfur) contain only rather small gas reserves, and tend to be of only local importance for supply to nearby customers. However, these types of fields have been developed, mostly in areas other than western Kazakhstan, such as in Kyzylorda, Zhambyl, Turkestan, and East Kazakhstan oblasts. Kazakhstan is looking for ways to expand the country’s existing gas resource base through developing new upstream acreage (see Section 6.3.1). The country has enacted new legislation, including the Improved Model Contract (IMC), to make investment in Kazakhstan’s upstream more attractive to investors (see below). 1 By international definitions for just “proven” (“1P”) reserves, Kazakhstan is considered to possess 2.3 T cm as of the end of 2020 (essentially unchanged since 2016), or 1.2% of the global total (BP Statistical Review of World Energy, July 2023). By this measure Kazakhstan ranks fourth among CIS countries (after Russia, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan) and 16 th in the world. 2 The reserves are reported according to the domestic definition (in categories A+B+C1+C2), which roughly correspond to the international equivalent of proven + probable (2P) reserves. Slightly more than half (about 57%) is associated gas (held in solution with liquid hydrocarbons in the reservoir) and the remainder is “free” gas (~1.6 T cm). The state balance for 2022 identifies gas reserves in 287 fields.Figure 6.1 Top 20 countries by recoverable gas reserves (proven+probable) (Tcm) Notes: *Includes conventional gas reserves (only US Gulf of Mexico & Alaska). Canada not included due to mined oil sands.Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global. 3 This represents a slight reduction in reserves estimates compared to that given in The National Energy Report 2021 (at 152 trillion cubic feet [4.4 T cm]), mainly due to the reevaluation of the Caspian region and the reserves for several larger fields, including Kashagan, T engiz, Rostoshinskoye, and Rozhkovskoye. 145 Table 6.1 Kazakhstan’s estimated 2P gas reserves by basin in 2023 BasinGas recoverable 2P reserves (MMscf)Gas recoverable 2P reserves (MMcm) Precaspian Basin 122,819,594 3,587,021 Mangyshlak-Central Caspian 7,977,885 232,999 North Ustyurt Basin 3,543,254 103,483 Turgay Basin 2,094,202 61,162 Volga-Urals Basin 503,970 14,719 Chu-Sarysu Basin 935,758 27,329 Zaysan Basin 165,290 4,827 North Caucasus Platform 25,000 730 To t a l 138,064,953 4,032,271 Notes: Data as of 25 July 2023; 2P = proven+probable.

Although the largest gas reserves are contained within the “Big 3” projects, where costly gas processing is required to produce commercial gas, the Plan also calls for QazaqGaz and KMG to develop a number of prospective gas fields over the next 5-7 years. Overall, the plan envisions that seven new gas-oil and gas-condensate fields will be put onstream, including Urikhtau, Prorva West, Pridorozhnoye, Anabay, Rozhkovskoye, Ansagan, and the T eplovsko-Tokarevskoye Group (see Figure 6.3 Kazakhstan’s new sources of gas: Planned upstream development by KMG and QazaqGaz). These upstream projects are expected to provide incremental raw gas production of up to 4.2 Bcm/y by 2030 (see Table 6.2 Kazakhstan’s prospective gas fields and expected \"new\" gas output by 2030 and Figure 6.4 New planned projects to increase gas production by 2030).QazaqGaz QazaqGaz announced that it plans to put three new fields into operation within the next five years. All three fields are located in the Chu-Sarysu Basin in south-central Kazakhstan: ►The Anabay field in Zhambyl Oblast is set to come online in Q3 2023. 4 The Anabay field was first discovered in 1979; its reserves are estimated at 3.1 Bcm. ►The Barkhannaya/Sultankuduk field, also in Zhambyl Oblast, is planned to be launched in 2026.5 Initially discovered in 1982, the field’s reserves are estimated at 0.5 Bcm. 4 Field development plans include drilling four wells (No. 17, 18, 19, 20) with planned depth of 3,500 m. Initial production is expected at 16 MMcm/y, with a later expansion to 40 MMcm/y, according to QazaqGaz. 5 QazaqGaz plans to drill three wells (B-5, B-6, К-1) at Barkhannaya, with expected production of 48 MMcm/y. 146 ►The third field, Pridorozhnoye in Turkestan Oblast, is currently in the design stage, with production slated for 2027.6 The Pridorozhnoye field’s reserves are estimated at around 16 Bcm; the field was discovered in 1973. The relatively modest reserves of these three fields as well as their remoteness from existing gas infrastructure were the key reasons why they were not developed previously.

The plan calls for increasing KMG’s gas output from 2.2 Bcm in 2022 to 6.7 Bcm in 2030, from a combination of current assets and the development of new ones. This focuses on the development of the Central Urikhtau and Prorva West onshore fields as particularly promising near-term targets (they have already been discovered), but includes other fields and blocks as well. 8 ►In May 2023, Kazgermunay, a joint venture between KMG and PetroKazakhstan Inc., launched the Aksai Yuzhny gas condensate field in Kyzylorda Oblast. With estimated reserves of ~2 Bcm, gas production is expected to be about 100 MMcm/y. ►By the end of 2023, KMG plans to put online the Rozhkovskoye gas condensate field in West Kazakhstan Oblast. 9 KMG owns 50% of the asset, with the remaining shares belonging to MOL (FED) Kazakhstan (27.5%) and First International Oil Corporation (FIOC) (22.5%). Recoverable condensate reserves are estimated at 12.5 MMt and recoverable gas reserves at 26.8 Bcm. KMG expects gas production of up to 1 Bcm/y from the field to be supplied to Zhaikmunai’s gas processing plant (Nostrum Oil & Gas Plc) for processing and subsequent delivery to the domestic market. ►Post-2024, KMG plans to develop the Central Urikhtau gas field, which is a gas play within the larger Urikhtau license area in Aktobe Oblast. KMG estimates potential gas production of 1 Bcm/y and 209,000 tons of condensate per year from the field. ►Post-2027, KMG wants to increase gas output from the Prorva West field in Atyrau Oblast through the expansion of gas treatment capacity and new production from the field’s gas-bearing horizons. 10 S&P Global estimates recoverable 2P gas reserves at ~38 Bcm while KMG’s subsidiary EmbaMunayGas reports 8.6 Bcm of ready-to-be developed gas reserves. ►KMG and the Ministry of Energy indicated several other sources of additional onshore gas production, including: (1) expansion of production at the (onshore) Kalamkas field; (2) new gas production at the Ansagan field 11 (Atyrau Oblast); and (3) exploration and production at the Teplovsko- Tokarevskoye group of fields.12 Geological information remains somewhat limited, but in general they present such operational challenges as small field size, unfavorable gas composition, or low flow rates. 13 In terms of other onshore exploration, KMG is searching for hydrocarbons in Turgay Paleozoic acreage in Kyzylorda Oblast (project timeframe 2021-27). The company plans to begin drilling a 5,500 m exploration well (PZ-1) in 2023, with further development contingent on drilling results. KMG estimates recoverable resources at 23.1 MMt of oil with required capex of 581 billion tenge ($1.3 billion) for project development. In June 2023, KMG and the Ministry of Energy of Kazakhstan signed a contract for hydrocarbon exploration and production in the Karaton Podsolevoy (Karaton Presalt, also known as Karaton-Sarykamys) onshore contract area, located in the Atyrau and Mangystau oblasts. The contract area is located near TCO’s T engiz and Korolevskoye fields, as well as a group of Embamunaygaz fields (KMG). Several post-salt shallow wells have been drilled and minor oil discoveries made in the area, but the new"}

In June 2022, KMG and Russia’s Tatneft entered into an agreement of intent on joint implementation of the Karaton-Sarykamys project. Tatneft is expected to provide carry-finance for the project. According to the Kazakh government’s draft resolution “On Approval of an Integrated Plan for Development of Major Oil and Gas and Petrochemical Projects in 2023-2027” from May 2023, financing for the Karaton-Sarykamys project could total $2.4 billion. Preparatory work to drill a deep exploration well is underway, with drilling scheduled to begin in 2024. But actual development and production are contingent on the discovery of hydrocarbons. In terms of offshore exploration, in February 2023 KMG and Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Energy signed a contract, governed by the new IMC framework, for the development of the offshore Kalamkas-More, Khazar, and Auezov fields as a single, integrated project. KMG has moved forward with its plans to co-develop the project with Russia’s Lukoil. 14 This project was previously rejected by international majors holding licenses to the fields due to challenging upstream economics. The signing 8 After QazaqGaz was designated a national operator for gas in November 2021, the government of Kazakhstan updated the rules for delineation of activities of national companies in the field of subsoil use. KMG is responsible for exploration and production of oil and gas resources at oil fields. QazaqGaz is responsible for exploration and production of gas resources at gas and gas condensate fields. The delimitation of activities between KMG and QazaqGaz is through mutual agreement. It appears that the gas fields currently on the books with KMG will remain so (QazaqGaz attempted to get these gas assets transferred over, but this failed to materialize). https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P2100000854. 9 The Rozhkovskoye gas condensate field was discovered in 2008 in West Kazakhstan Oblast (developed by Ural Oil and Gas). The contract for the production of gas and condensate at the field No. 4130-UVS-ME was signed in 2015. 10 Originally discovered in 1963, the Prorva West field was first put in production in 1977. KMG acquired additional seismic exploration data in 2007. 11 Initially discovered by TCO in 2006, Ansagan was acquired by Almex Plus LLP in early 2014. Ansagan was originally interpreted as an oil find, but in January 2017, the Ministry of Energy announced a discovery of “light oil and gas” pools in a Devonian reservoir. Although Ansagan is 100% owned by Almex Plus LLP, KMG appears under contract to do the appraisal work. 12 On 17 July 2023, Nostrum Oil & Gas completed the acquisition of an 80% interest in Positive Invest LLP, which holds the subsoil use rights for the Kamensko-T eplovsko-T okarevskoye area (the “Stepnoy Leopard fields”) in the northern part of the Precaspian Basin. Nostrum estimates that the Stepnoy Leopard fields hold between 50 MMboe and 150 MMboe of recoverable hydrocarbons, which are considered contingent resources, with only about 20% estimated to be liquids. The Stepnoy Leopard fields are located approximately 60-120 km west of Nostrum’s Chinarevskoye field and within 10 km of its oil and condensate loading terminal at Beles. Nostrum will work with Positive Invest to formulate field development plans for each of the eight fields and submit them to the Ministry of Energy for approval for tieback to Nostrum’s existing infrastructure, thereby improving the fields’ economic viability. Positive Invest’s contract expires in December 2044. First production launch is planned for 2025. 13 Another example is the Shyrak field in the northern Precaspian Basin near Karachaganak. A gas blow-out occurred there over a decade ago, with further activity on hold since then. 14 As of August 2023, KMG announced the completion of the final stage of the process of transferring to Lukoil a 50% stake in Kalamkas-Khazar Operating LLP, created specifically for the development of the Kalamkas-More, Khazar, and Auezov offshore deposits. The company intends to begin developing the project documentation phase by the end of 2023. 149 particularly international majors, will find the new legislative changes appealing enough to spend their money in Kazakhstan on upstream gas development and work with them on this endeavor. 6.4 Upstream Legal Framework Kazakhstan’s 2017 Subsoil Code stipulates that the state’s interests in the upstream natural gas sector are to be represented by the “National Company for Hydrocarbons.” The state—via the National Management Holding Group, the joint-stock company National Welfare Fund “Samruk-Kazyna” (NWF SK)—is the majority shareholder in this company. The Law on Gas and Gas Supply from January 2012 designates this company as the “national operator” for the county’s single-buyer model of gas procurement, transportation, and distribution. Prior to the end of 2021, it was a KMG subsidiary, JSC NC KazTransGas (KTG), that satisfied these criteria. In June 2021, President T okayev emphasized the need for a new gas strategy concept that would transform KTG into a full-fledged vertically integrated national gas company with activities spanning the entire gas value chain. So in November 2021, a 100% ownership stake in KazTransGas JSC was transferred from KMG to Samruk-Kazyna. On 31 December 2021, the Government of Kazakhstan approved the Comprehensive Plan for Kazakhstan’s Gas Industrybonus for the project amounts to $32 million, with expected capex of at least $6 billion. 15 NCOC, the international consortium developing the Kashagan field, discovered Kalamkas-More in 2002, located 75 km southwest of the Kashagan field. S&P Global estimates Kalamkas-More 2P reserves at 21.4 MMt (156.5 MMbl) of oil and 6 Bcm of gas. The Khazar field was discovered by the Shell-led Caspi Meruerty Operating Company (CMOC), also known as the Pearls Production Sharing Agreement (PSA), in 2007. 16 It is located about 40 km southwest of Kalamkas-More and was a part of the Zhemchuzhiny (Pearls) discoveries that also included the Auezov and Naryn fields. 17 S&P Global estimates the Khazar field’s 2P reserves at 23 MMt (167 MMbl) of oil and 2.7 Bcm of gas. Both the Kalamkas-More and Khazar fields are part of the North Ustyurt Basin, characterized by relatively shallow reservoir depths (1,500–2,000 m) with no salt layer in the section. This contrasts with the"}

The combined reserves of the Kalamkas-More and Khazar fields were reported at 80 MMt of oil and 9 Bcm of gas. KMG is conducting geological exploration at the Abay 18 and Al- Farabi (known formerly as the I-P-2 block) offshore projects. In July 2023, KMG and its partner Lukoil exited the Zhenis block after an unsuccessful exploration well failed to find commercial reserves. 19 As seen from the extensive list above, both QazaqGaz and KMG have ambitious plans to expand upstream gas exploration and production. A question, though, is whether other investors, 18 In July 2019, Italy’s Eni and KMG signed a hydrocarbons exploration and production contract for the Abay block in the Kazakh sector of the Caspian Sea. The block’s reserves are estimated at 760 MMtoe (~5.5 billion boe). The agreement between KMG and Eni provides for the drilling of one exploration well (2,500 m depth) and a 2D seismic survey of 700 linear km, with estimated costs of over 14 billion tenge (about $31 million). 19 KMG and Lukoil signed a contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons at the Zhenis block in April 2019. The first offshore well was spudded at Zhenis in December 2022. The minimum obligations for the project were to drill one exploration well and to conduct 3D seismic surveys; estimated costs were on the order of $60 million. Lukoil financed 100% of the exploration costs of the Zhenis project. The license has now been returned to the state.15 Pending Lukoil’s ability to provide the requisite financing, the project is expected to generate about 2,000 new jobs and aims to support Kazakh companies and contractors and leverage Kazakh ports and other facilities. 16 At the time, CMOC shareholders were Shell (40%), Oman Pearls Company (20%), and KMG (40%). 17 Auezov’s 2P reserves are estimated at 5 MMt (36.5 MMbl) of oil and 0.3 Bcm of gas.Figure 6.5 KMG’s plans to increase gas output by asset type (MMcm/y) Source: KMG, S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global. 150 ROLE OF QAZAQGAZ AS A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED NATIONAL COMPANY Under current legislation, QazaqGaz not only remains the monopoly operator of all gas transmission and distribution infrastructure in the country but also has exclusive rights to purchase (associated) gas from producers, sell gas on the domestic market, and export gas. The creation of independent QazaqGaz is part of a “re-branding” effort, signaling a new approach to the company’s role, extending beyond its previous chief focus on gas transport to focus more comprehensively on broad development of the overall gas resource in the country. It is intended to improve the overall investment attractiveness of the gas sector, increase geological exploration, improve domestic gas pricing policies, and promote further gasification of the economy (including in transportation and deeper processing in the petrochemical industry). This new approach reflects: ►A changed view of natural gas from being only a by-product of liquid hydrocarbons to a valuable resource in its own right ►A desire for greater openness to outside investment and international metrics (e.g., international audits, Western metrics of business performance) ► A changed pricing policy for gas in the domestic market to stimulate upstream development, and netback pricing for export-oriented industry ► Creation of new upstream (E&P) segment, based on a renewed effort to attract development (new Model Contract, special upstream terms for gas) and perhaps also an international dimension (e.g., developing gas in Turkmenistan) ► An embrace of imports to augment domestic supply as needed (from Turkmenistan and Russia) ► Continued focus on greenhouse gas emissions reductions, especially of methane; this harmonizes with efforts to burnish the company’s “green” credentials and increase its attractiveness to investors; these are to be implemented through upgrading/refurbishing pipeline networks and deploying digital and remote technologies for leak detection ► The goal of an eventual initial public offering (IPO) of stock (now expected in 2024-25). As the country’s designated “single buyer,” QazaqGaz purchases gas from upstream producers (for domestic consumption), handles gas import purchases, and dispatches Kazakh-produced gas destined for export. The logic of putting Kazakhstan’s gas production and acquisition in the hands of a single national operator is to: ►Empower QazaqGaz to develop the domestic market and pipeline infrastructure through revenues derived from sales to domestic consumers and from exports and gas transit ► Enable the state-owned entity to capture any upside from the difference between producer prices and higher domestic end-user and export prices ►Maintain a single channel for exports, which harmonizes with the near-monopoly situations in its two main gas-purchasing customers, Russia and China, as well as with conditions Kazakhstan wants to continue in the forthcoming EAEU single market. QazaqGaz derives its revenues from three key operating activities (gas sales to the domestic markets, exports, and gas transit) as well as several auxiliary activities (e.g., pipeline servicing) (see Figure 6.6 QazaqGaz reported revenues by source of activity and costs of goods sold). Given that (regulated) low end-user prices (which do not fully cover its production and transportation costs) reverberate throughout the value chain, QazaqGaz generates financial losses in its basic business of selling gas to domestic consumers. Between 2015 and 2021 the company incurred a total of 587 billion tenge ($1.38 billion) in losses on domestic gas deliveries. QazaqGaz estimates its losses from domestic market sales may reach 1 trillion tenge ($2.2 billion) for the period 2022-26 if no changes are made to domestic marketing operations. Nonetheless, since 2016 QazaqGaz has generated positive net income in its overall operations, thanks entirely to additional revenues from expanded gas exports to China (since 2018) and higher gas transit (since 2016) (see Figure 6.7 Consolidated financial results for QazaqGaz). In 2018, Chinese export revenues jumped to $1.43 billion, up from $0.59 billion in 2017. In 2022, export revenues amounted to $1.01 billion, similar to the 2021 value of $1.05 billion, reflecting relatively higher unit gas prices in 2022 despite lower exports. Thus, availability of gas"}

Yet further gasification means that the unprofitable segment of QazaqGaz’s business will continue to grow, while export volumes are likely to shrink, given the constraints on available supplies of commercial gas in Kazakhstan. For this reason, QazaqGaz has championed a number of changes in domestic gas pricing policy and the investment environment that are described later in this report. The company continues to push for additional amendments to encourage upstream gas developments and expanded flexibility to adjust regulated prices and tariffs.Development for 2022–2026 that reorganized KazTransGas into a new national company JSC National Company QazaqGaz. At the same time, the Kazakh government updated the Decree “On approval of the delimitation of the activities of national companies in the field of subsoil use,” whereby QazaqGaz was designated as responsible for exploration and production of natural gas at gas and gas-condensate fields (see text box Role of QazaqGaz as a vertically integrated national company). 151 Figure 6.6 QazaqGaz reported revenues by source of activity and costs of goods sold (billion tenge) Source: QazaqGaz financial reporting, S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global. Figure 6.7 Consolidated financial results for QazaqGaz (million US$) Source: QazaqGaz financial reporting, S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global . 152 6.5 Stimulating Greater Investment in Exploration and Upstream Activity In order to secure the substantial incremental volumes of gas called for in the Comprehensive Plan, to reach 42.1 Bcm of commercial gas by 2030 (from 35.7 Bcm in 2022), policymakers in government and in the national companies KMG and QazaqGaz are looking at various ways to stimulate investment in upstream exploration and production. T wo prominent approaches that have emerged focus on: (a) lowering the costs of exploration and production from new fields and improving the legal environment surrounding their licensing (embodied in the Improved Model Contract); and (b) increasing the prices that producers receive for gas from these new developments. 20 6.5.1 Improved Model Contract The initial impetus to create the Improved Model Contract (IMC) emerged from a November 2020 meeting of the Foreign Investors Council (FIC), an advisory body to the Kazakh government established in 1998 to promote dialogue between state authorities and foreign investors. 21 There, the Kazakh leadership and major investors discussed the progress being made in drafting an IMC. The key problem IMC attempts to address is mitigating the high costs of upstream development in Kazakhstan, where much of hydrocarbon reserves are found in difficult, “complex” fields. The economics of offshore Kazakh projects are also challenged by the heavy dependence on imported equipment and services and the difficult logistics of bringing them to the field. There was a broad understanding that the way to address this problem of high costs was to offer regulatory and fiscal terms that offer stability and lower taxes to help reduce overall and upfront costs of upstream development. In January 2023, Kazakhstan’s long-awaited IMC went into effect, and soon thereafter, on 6 February 2023, Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Energy and KMG signed the first subsoil use contract based on the IMC for the production of hydrocarbons at the Kalamkas More, Khazar, and Auezov offshore fields in the Caspian Sea. Russia’s Lukoil is KMG’s strategic partner in the project and will enter the project on a 50-50 basis. In June 2023, the Ministry of Energy and KMG concluded another IMC contract for the complex onshore Karaton-Sarkamys field. Russia’s Tatneft signed an agreement of intent to implement the Karaton-Sarkamys exploration project with KMG and to provide carry-financing. Therefore, it can be said that the IMC already has been successful in attracting two foreign investors’ participation in a major project, but Kazakhstan is clearly hoping for additional projects. A key metric for its success will be the signing of contracts with other operators, particularly Western international majors. Given the current geopolitical situation, Russian investors do appear to carry additional risks to the implementation of the projects. 6.5.1.1 The IMC applies only to “complex” fields The Improved Model Contract is designed to incentivize both oil and gas development upstream. Importantly, the IMC only applies to new “complex” projects (in undeveloped fields, even if the actual reserves have already been discovered). It does not apply to other types of deposits, or to contracts concluded before the introduction of the IMC, nor does it apply to their subsequent extensions. 22 More specifically, the IMC applies to three categories of complex fields: ►Offshore fields that are fully or partially located in the Kazakh sector of the Caspian or Aral seas ►Onshore fields where one of the following applies: Contain unconventional hydrocarbon reserves Have hydrocarbon reservoirs at 4,500 meters or deeper Have a hydrogen sulfide content in the formation fluid of 3.5% or more Have deposits with abnormally high reservoir pressure with an anomaly coefficient of 1.5 or more 23 Have subsalt reservoirs with a salt layer thickness of more than 100 meters The discovered reservoirs are considered non-structural traps. ►Onshore gas projects, including gas or gas condensate projects or projects where oil-saturated accumulations account for less than a quarter of the total volume of hydrocarbons in the field. 20 Kazakhstan has taken other important steps in recent years to improve the regulatory framework governing upstream investment as well, especially through implementation (starting in 2018) of amendments to both the Tax Code and the Subsoil and Subsoil Use Code. 21 For additional details about the Improved Model Contract and the Kalamkas More–Khazar project approved on its basis, see S&P Global Commodity Insights, Regional Integrated Insight, Kazakhstan’s Long-Awaited Improved Model Contract for Hydrocarbon Exploration and Production Signed into Law: Have conditions improved enough to spur new upstream exploration? 13 March 2023.22 However, there is a process whereby operators of fields regulated under existing standard subsoil contracts can retroactively apply for IMC terms for subsoil plots that otherwise meet the geological criteria listed for a complex deposit, provided that: they are still at the exploration stage (onshore and offshore fields) or at the exploration"}

The contract specifically states that tax obligations are established for the subsoil user in accordance with Kazakhstan’s current tax legislation and only select preferences, specified by the Article 722-1 of the Tax Code, are stable as of the date of signing the contract. Stability also does not apply to environmental legislation or the legislation on competition protection. Specifically, the Subsoil Code guarantees that amendments and additions to Kazakhstan’s legislation that negatively affect the economics of a subsoil user’s projects do not apply to contracts concluded before such amendments and additions are adopted. However, these guarantees are not immune to future changes in regulations governing national security, defense, environmental safety, health care, taxation, customs, and protection of competition. The only exception to what is specified in the Subsoil Code applies to customs regulation, which provides temporary exemption from crude oil export customs duties produced under the IMC for complex projects. Also, all existing procedures for the approval of basic project documents such as industrial safety or environmental analysis, required by the current legislation on subsoil and subsoil use, are maintained and applied to IMC. 6.5.1.3 Obligations in the IMC In addition to regulatory and fiscal preferences (i.e., incentives), the IMC also specifies a number of obligations of the subsoil user, which if unfulfilled can result in fines and other penalties up to the termination of contract. These requirements include the following: ►Local content requirements for specialists and workers of at least 70% (for a simple [not improved] typical model contract, this share is 50%); other percentages for managers or structural division chiefs cannot be lower than 50%. At the same time, the IMC states that the subsoil user can attract the necessary foreign labor to conduct subsoil operations. ►Mandatory creation of a program to develop local suppliers of goods, works, and services during the production period, approved and overseen by the competent authority. The 50% minimum requirement in the previously existing model contract does not apply to the Improved Model Contract for complex fields. ►If one of the subsoil users is a foreign legal entity, contracts are drawn up in three languages (English, Kazakh, and Russian), with preference given to Kazakh- and Russian-language texts. ►Obligation to develop and fulfill the work program indicating the scope, type, and timing of exploration work broken down annually (in the previously existing contract, the program is created for the entire exploration period, not by annual increments) (Article 7). ►A new Paragraph 12 in the IMC, titled “Additional Obligation of the Subsoil User,” adds a requirement in the case of a large discovery. It states that if initial hydrocarbon reserves exceed 100 MMt of oil or 50 Bcm of natural gas, after 20 years 24 Any oil or gas produced during the exploration phase must be supplied to domestic market. 154 from the date of"}

When compared with the terms offered by countries that have been successful in attracting international E&P capital recently, it may still fall short. Globally, the uncertainty over the longer-term hydrocarbon demand trajectory, limited investor appetite, and the impact of the energy transition are forcing E&P companies to be selective in which greenfield projects they pursue. 25 Operators now tend to focus on “advantaged” barrels and fields with proven reserves, near existing infrastructure, or that afford relatively fast return on investment, like shale plays. Upstream operators worldwide have largely shifted from expensive, large-scale, single-project investments to small- or medium-scale projects, and those ventures with multiphase expansion opportunities with economical break-even prices are expected to account for the majority of new-source conventional crude oil production over the next two decades. The gains that larger operators have made since 2014 in reducing cycle times are allowing them to commit to fast-tracking successful “emerging” basins such as Guyana/ Suriname and Namibia. Although global upstream investment has been rising from a trough in 2020, this is mostly on account of upstream capital investment instead of exploration. Meanwhile, companies are cutting exploration financing and budgeting—the most direct and riskiest form of value addition in the upstream. The scale of global exploration is declining, with the number of players and the size of the effort constricting, with annual average wildcat well numbers declining. 26 Currently, even though companies are relatively flush with cash, they are not returning to even the pre–COVID-19 level of exploration activity. Generally, oil and gas companies are showing restraint with investment into the hydrocarbon sector, notwithstanding a renewed focus by policymakers on the adequacy of near-term supply reflecting national security concerns (see Chapter 2). Kazakhstan faces these challenges along with numerous other factors associated with its land-locked location in Eurasia, neighboring a key transit country (Russia) that is handicapped by international sanctions. This means that for Kazakhstan to attract quality upstream investment, it needs not only to introduce improved terms, but—for lack of a better term—the best terms. The introduction of the IMC undoubtedly will help to de- risk upstream development of Kazakhstan’s complex fields. However, despite notable improvements, the IMC retains elements whereby the investor is not fully protected against arbitrary unilateral decisions by the state. More specifically: ►The IMC fails to provide full long-term tax guarantees throughout the duration of a typical project (25–45 years). ►The IMC leaves the door open for changes in legislation (i.e., new regulations governing national security, defense, environmental safety, health care, taxation, customs, and protection of competition) that have the potential to greatly alter project economics. The contract’s new obligations for subsoil users (e.g., regarding local content) also may discourage some investment vis-à-vis locations where such obligations are not present. Therefore, the IMC by itself has not yet created a dynamic where the government is viewed as a partner and facilitator for investors, in a global environment in which Kazakhstan is competing with other countries for limited upstream investment funds. However, Kazakhstan is working to further develop its economy. In September 2023, in accordance with the Decree issued by President Kassym-Jomart T okayev, the Plan for Implementation of the Measures Outlined in the “Economic Course of a Fair Kazakhstan” Address was approved, encompassing the country’s gradual transition to a new economic development model and an increase in its investment attractiveness. 27 It will include: ►Simplifying and shortening of the procurement process (based on the principle of prioritizing quality over price, and full automation of procedures). ►Attracting large private investments in order to unlock the sector’s potential. ►Granting priority [preferential] subsoil use rights to investors carrying out geological exploration at their own expense. ►Reducing the project approval timeframe and procedures by half through the introduction of a comprehensive state expert review and full digitalization of the process. 25 Although the focus of interest here is on gas, and not liquids, because of the fact that most prospective gas reserves in Kazakhstan consist of associated gas (combined with liquids in the field), liquids demand is often the primary driver of investment decisions. 26 S&P Global Commodity Insights, Executive Briefings, Global Upstream: Top trends for 2023, 1 February 2023. 27 https://www.pnp.ru/top/site/kasym-zhomart-tokaev-provozglasil-ekonomicheskiy-kurs-spravedlivogo-kazakhstana.html. 155 ►Resetting the tariff policy, introducing new tariff-setting methodologies, and increasing the sector’s investment attractiveness. ►Introducing adequate market tariffs for 5-7 years for all natural monopolists. A guaranteed long-term tariff will allow for planning investments and serve as “hard” [reliable] collateral when obtaining loans. ►It is also important to attract investment in the exploration and development of new gas fields. Oil and gas giants – T engiz, Kashagan, Karachaganak – should be reliable suppliers of affordable gas. ►Preferential treatment should be granted according to clear rules, without connection to individual projects or persons. ►Transferring tax administration to a service-type model of interaction between fiscal authorities and taxpayers with the goal of warning rather than punishing. ►Complete digitalization of tax control, reduction of tax reporting forms by 30%; reduction of the total number of types of tax payments and other obligatory payments to the budget by 20%. 6.5.2 The new producer price framework for incentivizing exploration At the end of 2022, the government of Kazakhstan passed important amendments to the Law on Gas and Gas"}

For all new gas, the new producer price will be a weighted sum of the domestic and export parity price, adjusted for transportation costs 28, a commission for QazaqGaz, and a field complexity index, where: Pproducer = 70% * P0 + 30% * Pdomestic P0 = Ccomplexity * (Pexport – Ttransport – – QGcommission – Iinvestment) Pproducer – producer price at which the national operator purchases new gas, in tenge per Mcm; Pdomestic – the average (arithmetic mean) wholesale price of commercial gas on the domestic market, approved for the current calendar year; Pexport – the current export price of commercial gas at the border of the Republic of Kazakhstan with the People’s Republic of China, determined on the basis of information received from the national operator; Ttransport – pipeline transportation costs from the subsoil user to the border with China, in tenge per Mcm; QG commission – national operator’s profitability component of up to 10% of the current export price of commercial gas at the Kazakh-Chinese border (excluding gas transportation costs through the gas pipeline network from the subsoil user to the border with China), in tenge per Mcm; I investment – expenses for the transportation of commercial gas to the planned place of sale to the national operator, determined on the basis of tariffs approved by the authorized body in charge of natural monopolies and regulated markets, in tenge per Mcm; C complexity – the field development complexity factor is based on satisfying a definition for a complex field as specified in subparagraphs 1) and 2) of paragraph 1-2 of Article 36 of the Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Subsoil and Subsoil Use.” ►The coefficient equals 1 if one of the two parameters are satisfied ►The coefficient equals 0.8 if the two parameters are not satisfied. The parameters as described in the subparagraph 1 refer to offshore fields and in subparagraph 2 refer to complex onshore fields with at least one of the specified criteria fulfilled. The definition of complexity coefficient means that simpler onshore gas fields get the lower 0.8 coefficient applied to their gas price. These are the fields where QazaqGaz is currently focusing its attention. Naturally, the national operator is proposing further amendments to the Law “On Gas and Gas Supply” to allow for even better prices. With the currently established more favorable producer prices and the preferences incorporated in the Improved Model Contract, the government optimistically estimates possible additional gas supply on the order of 4.2-6.7 Bcm/y by 2030. For subsoil projects concluded before 1 January 2023 and not increasing their gas output, the prior price arrangement, established through a “cost-plus” price mechanism, still holds: Production cost ($/Mcm) + processing cost ($/Mcm) + transmission tariff to point of sale to QazaqGaz ($/Mcm) + profit margin (< 10%). 29 The introduction of higher producer gas prices is a welcome development, although any success remains contingent on the continuing reforms that ensure end-user prices rise to eventually reflect at least the total costs of delivered gas. The still relatively low regulated end-user prices pressure all aspects 28 Transportation costs are separated in the legislation to include (1) transportation costs to the point of sale to QazaqGaz and (2) across Kazakhstan to the national border.29 Kazakhstan’s Law on Natural Monopolies and supporting rules issued by KREM establish a methodology to calculate an acceptable profit rate for gas transportation companies (KTG and subsidiaries) based on their regulated asset base, which reflects their expenditures and investment programs. In practice, determination of end-user prices still follows a “cost-plus” approach where an acceptable profit rate is believed to be no more than 10%. 156 of the domestic gas value and force QazaqGaz to drive a hard bargain in negotiating gas prices with gas producers. In 2022, the average producer price for natural gas was 18,139 tenge/Mcm ($39.5/Mcm), and by June 2023 it was up to 24,008 tenge/Mcm ($53.5/Mcm) (see Figure 6.8 Monthly trends in domestic gas prices in Kazakhstan (tenge/Mcm) and Figure 6.9 Monthly trends in domestic gas prices in Kazakhstan ($/Mcm)). The average producer price for associated gas was 11,371 tenge/Mcm ($24.7/Mcm) in 2022, and 17,596 tenge/Mcm ($39.2/Mcm) in June 2023.

However, 2022 gross gas output was also lower for more than half of the other gas producers in Kazakhstan, corresponding to the oil production declines in 2021-22. For 2023, S&P Global estimates gross production to reach about 57 Bcm. Volumes of commercial gas, excluding reinjected volumes, amounted to 36.0 Bcm in 2022 versus 36.8 Bcm in 2021, continuing a declining trend ongoing since 2019 (see Table 6.4 Kazakhstan’s natural gas balance 2015-23). 31 For 2023, commercial gas production is expected to reverse the declining trend and grow to 37 Bcm, driven in large part by rising Kashagan output.Most of the gas produced in Kazakhstan is a by-product of oil production (associated gas), with a large share of the remaining gas output coming from the Karachaganak field, also primarily designed to extract liquid hydrocarbons (e.g., gas condensate) (see"}

In 2022, 61.5% of gross gas production was associated gas, and another 36.5% was the “natural” gas from Karachaganak. The share of the remaining natural gas was less than 2% in 2022. This heavy dependence on associated gas makes it difficult to scale commercial gas output in response to demand. The “Big 3” projects – T engiz, Karachaganak, and Kashagan – accounted for 81.6% of Kazakhstan’s gross gas production in 2022 and 73.1% of commercial gas production (see Figure 6.11 “Big 3” share in commercial gas production in Kazakhstan). The “Big 3” have considerable reinjection needs for pressure maintenance and enhancement of liquid hydrocarbons recovery, although reinjection at a smaller scale also occurs at several smaller producers in Kyzylorda and Mangystau oblasts. 32 In 2022, total reinjection amounted to 17.2 Bcm or 32.3% of gross output, versus 17.3 Bcm (32%) in 2021. Over the past decade, the share of reinjection remained at around 25%-38% of gross output (see Figure 6.12 Kazakhstan’s gross and commercial gas production). Going forward, reinjection is expected to remain an important, economically effective gas utilization option for upstream operators. 30 Some official data (IACNG, KazStat) still report gross gas production for 2021 as 53.8 Bcm. 31 Gross production includes total volumes extracted from the reservoir, so it also includes all non-methane components, including hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, etc. It also includes reinjected volumes. In standard international statistical practice, reported production does not include reinjected volumes, but only “commercial” output available for on-site project use and distribution to consumers.Table 6.4 Kazakhstan’s natural gas balance 2015-23 (Bcm/y) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023* Production (gross)** 45.3 46.4 52.9 55.5 56.4 55.4 54.2 53.2 56.6 Production (commercial output) 28.4 35.2 39.8 41.2 41.0 38.1 36.8 36.0 36.9 Imports 4.9 5.8 5.1 5.7 8.8 4.3 9.3 7.4 6.4 Exports 13.3 12.8 16.8 19.1 19.4 16.7 14.8 13.0 12.2 Net exports 8.5 7.0 11.8 13.4 10.6 12.4 5.5 5.6 5.8 Apparent consumption (commercial gas) 20.7 27.4 27.9 27.9 29.4 29.3 30.6 30.4 31.1 Consumption (end-of-pipe deliveries) 12.0 13.1 14.0 15.1 15.9 17.1 18.6 19.3 20.0 Notes: *Data for 2023 are estimated; **Including re-injected volumes.Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global. 32 Currently, seven out of 80 subsoil users operating in Kazakhstan reinject associated gas back into reservoir to maintain liquids production, according to the Prime Minister of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Alikhan Smailov; see Kapital, https://kapital.kz/economic/117771/na-baze-kashagana-realizuyet-sya-dopolnitel-nyy-proyekt-gazopererabatyvayushchego-zavoda.html, accessed 31 July 2023. 158 Figure 6.10 Gas production in Kazakhstan: Associated versus non-associated (Bcm/y) Notes: Gross production, including reinjected volumes.

Figure 6.11 \"Big 3\" share in commercial gas production in Kazakhstan Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global. 159 6.6.2 S&P Global’s base-case gas production outlook S&P Global’s outlooks for Kazakhstan’s natural gas production to 2050 are tied to those for Kazakhstan’s liquids production (see Figure 6.13 Outlook for Kazakhstan’s gross gas production by scenario). 33 The government’s official production outlook is presented below. In the S&P outlook, increases in gas production over the medium time frame largely depend on timing of expansion phases of the mega-projects, particularly Kashagan; expanded production from “new” field development by KMG and QazaqGaz is likely to be less decisive, particularly in the medium term. In the base case, gross gas output will likely peak in 2030 at about 70 Bcm/y, as subsequent (slower) growth in mega-projects fails to offset declines elsewhere. Post-2030, gas production enters a period of steady decline, contracting to about 50 Bcm/y by 2050 (see Table 6.5 Kazakhstan’s natural gas balance: S&P Global base-case outlook 2020-50). Between 2022 and 2030, almost all of the net increase in gross gas output (16.1 Bcm) is expected to come from the “Big 3” projects – Kashagan (6.1 Bcm), T engiz (4.6 Bcm) and Karachaganak (5.9 Bcm), while gross output from other sources (primarily mature fields) is slated to decline by around 0.5 Bcm. By 2030, KPO will remain the largest gross gas producer (25.3 Bcm in 2030), with commercial output at about 11 Bcm. By 2050, the main gas producers will be Karachaganak (18.0 Bcm gross, 9.0 Bcm commercial), Kashagan (16.6 Bcm gross, 10.0 Bcm commercial), and T engiz (5.3 Bcm gross, 5.0 Bcm commercial). Gas output from other producers is set to continue to contract, with declines in mature fields failing to offset gas production increases in the “other offshore” category. 34 In the high production case, corresponding to the high production case in oil output, gas production peaks at almost 90 Bcm in 2035 and then declines to 58 Bcm by 2050. In the low production case, Kashagan phase 2 does not materialize, and gas production peaks at 61 Bcm in 2025 and declines to 27 Bcm by 2050. Commercial volumes will likely peak somewhat later, in the mid- 2030s, at around 42 Bcm/y, as construction of new gas processing capacity will take some time. After 2035, commercial output begins declining due to sustained high reinjection needs, limited further expansion in gas processing capacity, and challenges to commercial use posed by low producer and end-user prices (as discussed below). Commercial production from the “Big 3” is expected to follow a similar trajectory, peaking in 2035 and declining slowly thereafter. Karachaganak’s commercial gas output remains stable through 2045 at about 10-11 Bcm/y, while T engiz’s commercial gas deliveries peak during 2025-30 at around 12.5 Bcm/y, and decline slowly thereafter. At Kashagan, commercial gas output rises to 10 Bcm by 2035 (assuming completion of new gas processing facilities near the Bolashak oil and gas treatment complex) and remains at that level through the forecast period (see Figure 6.14 Kazakhstan’s gas production profile to 2050: S&P Global base-case outlook). 35 The new gas processing plant near Bolashak, with capacity of 1.0 Bcm/y of raw gas (yielding 750 MMcm/y of dry gas) is already under construction, due to be completed by 2025. The S&P Global outlook"}

A 5 Bcm/y gas processing facility at Karachaganak is also expected to be launched in 2032 (the official launch date is 2028).Figure 6.12 Kazakhstan’s gross and commercial natural gas production (Bcm/y) Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global. 33 For descriptions of the three scenarios’ underlying assumptions, please see Chapter 1 of this report. 34 S&P Global expects that gas production in the “other offshore” category, i.e., other than Kashagan, will have significant reinjection needs, with most of the gas reinjected into reservoir, however, some gas production is likely to be processed into pipeline-quality gas and delivered to end-users.35 In December 2021, QazaqGaz (then NC KazTransGas JSC) and the NCOC partners signed an agreement on joint work on the basic engineering of Phase 2A of the Kashagan project. Phase 2A (currently under review) would increase total liquids output to 500,000 b/d (23.7 MMt/y) with an option of an additional 2 Bcm/y of raw gas supplied to an expanded QazaqGaz gas processing plant. An FID is expected in 2023, with project start-up in 2026 (capex $1.6-$1.8 billion). Phase 2B would bring NCOC’s total liquids production to 700,000 b/d. An additional 6 Bcm/y of raw gas would be made available, either for a new processing plant or perhaps for TCO’s existing facilities to utilize. An FID is expected in 2024, with project start-up in 2030 (capex $3.0-$3.5 billion). 160 Notes: *Including re-injected volumes.

Most of Kazakhstan’s gas output requires processing. There are five major gas processing plants (GPZs) in Kazakhstan, a number of smaller plants, and also an important arrangement for the processing of Karachaganak’s gas across the border at Russia’s Orenburg gas processing plant (OGPZ). T otal capacity of Kazakhstan’s gas processing plants in 2023 was 38.8 Bcm/y with a utilization rate of 74% (see Table 6.6 Kazakhstan’s gas processing plants). The five main plants are T engiz (13 Bcm/y capacity in Atyrau Oblast), Zhanazhol (8.4 Bcm/y capacity in Aktobe Oblast), Bolashak (6.3 Bcm/y capacity in Atyrau Oblast), Chinarevskaya GTU (4.2 Bcm capacity in West Kazakhstan Oblast), and KMG subsidiary KazGPZ (1.5 Bcm/y capacity in Mangistau Oblast). Only the T engiz and Bolashak plants have more complex technology capable of processing sour associated gas, while the other plants are smaller and technologically simpler. Both T engiz and Bolashak plants are operating at capacity, which means that any additional increases in commercial gas output from these two fields would necessitate construction of new sophisticated GPZs. Nearly all of Karachaganak’s raw (high-sulfur) gas output that is not reinjected (9 Bcm in 2021) is sent across the border to Russia for processing at Gazprom’s Orenburg GPZ under a long-term agreement. 36 Part of the commercial gas from the Orenburg GPZ is sent back to Kazakhstan (to QazaqGaz), and the rest previously was sold under export contracts through Gazprom. Since 2018, however, the total volume of “exported” gas has contracted, with the bulk of processed Karachaganak gas redirected towards the Kazakh domestic market. Currently, the Orenburg GPZ is facing technical issues related to the acceptance of additional volumes of high-sulfur Karachaganak gas and needs certain technological upgrades to do this. 37 Although the relationship with the Orenburg GPZ will continue into the future, KPO has proposed building a new 4 Bcm/y gas processing plant in Kazakhstan, tentatively scheduled for completion in 2028. 38 This GPZ was included in the Roadmap for the Implementation of the Gas Strategy and was developed by KPO together with PSA LLP. In addition to the 4 Bcm/y at the proposed KPO GPZ, Kazakhstan plans to add another 6 Bcm/y of additional gas processing capacity by 2030, thus adding 10 Bcm/y of new processing capacity. 36 KPO sends about 8-9 Bcm/y of raw (sour) gas to the Orenburg GPZ for processing under a GSPA in place through 2038. Kazakhstan (i.e., the joint venture KazRosGaz) receives ~7-8 Bcm of dry, pipeline-quality gas from the plant. 37 Nonetheless, in June 2022, QazaqGaz and Gazprom signed an agreement for 2023, where the Orenburg GPZ is to process over 9.33 Bcm of Karachaganak gas, compared to 8.1 Bcm planned for 2022. According to QazaqGaz Annual Report 2022, the final agreed upon raw gas intake by the Orenburg GPZ in 2023 is 8.7 Bcm. 38 In June 2022, QazaqGaz and Gazprom signed a memorandum of cooperation that envisions an increase in KPO gas processing volumes at the Orenburg GPZ up to 11 Bcm/y.Figure 6.14 Kazakhstan’s gas production profile to 2050: S&P Global base-case outlook (Bcm) Notes: *Other Western Kazakhstan includes fields in the Atyrau, West Kazakhstan, and Mangystau oblasts, excluding the “Big 3.”Here S&P Global defines commercial gas volumes as gross gas production minus reinjected volumes; thus, commercial production includes volumes that disappear as other upstream usage and losses.

The other three planned plants include: ►QazaqGaz GPZ: This is a new 1.0 Bcm/y raw gas processing plant under construction at the Kashagan field.39 Dry gas output is expected at 0.750 Bcm/y; capex is about $860 million with a planned launch in 2025.40 ►Kashagan 2A GPZ: Construction of another GPZ with a capacity of 4 Bcm/y based on Kashagan gas output from Phase 2A is currently being discussed. 41 A number of investors have been proposed for this project, including from China (CNPC) and Qatar. In late July 2023, Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov revealed that NCOC shareholders and the operator (NCOC) are implementing the project with 2028 as a planned commissioning date. Capex estimates are likely to be around $4 billion. 42 ►Zhanaozen GPZ: KMG plans to build a new Zhanaozen GPZ that should replace the existing (and quite dilapidated) KazGPZ. Construction is now set to begin in the fall of 2023, with the date for scheduled completion consequently pushed back to 2026. The plant’s capacity will be 0.9 Bcm/y of raw gas andit will produce 759 MMcm/y commercial gas, 232,000 tons of LPGs, and 82,000 tons of pentane-hexane fraction. Capex is estimated at $372 million (167.6 billion tenge). 43 Construction of the Zhanaozen GPZ should be comparatively simpler than construction of any of the other three GPZs; its raw gas is a lot less complex than the associated gas at Kashagan. Indeed, S&P Global estimates that the cost of gas processing at Zhanaozen is around $117/Mcm without taking into account other by-products. Meanwhile, complex gas processing capacity at Kashagan requires significantly higher capex per unit of capacity. The estimated indicative recovery cost for the 1 Bcm GPZ at Kashagan ($860 million capex) is very high at around $230/Mcm. Moreover, higher gas processing also means more sulfur extraction, and that brings storage requirements and marketing headaches, and necessitates greater attention to compliance with environmental regulations. T o attract investment to gas development and production, the government of Kazakhstan has adopted amendments to the Tax Code, including a revised gas pricing formula for “new” gas (new projects or additional output from existing ones). However, incentives for new gas processing have not been incorporated into legislation or the Improved Model Contract. 39 In September 2023, NCOC began construction of a 15-km feeder pipe from its Bolashak facility. 40 The GPZ was initially scheduled to go into operation in the fourth quarter of 2023. QazaqGaz took over the project in June 2022 from the previous operator, GPC Investment LLP. In February 2023, QazaqGaz reported that a comprehensive audit discovered “critical shortcomings” in the project design that pushed the completion of the GPZ back to 2025. Initially the plant’s capacity was planned to be 1.15 Bcm/y with dry gas output at 0.815 Bcm/y.41 This doubles the amount of available raw gas processing capacity in Phase 2A compared to the agreement signed between the NCOC partners and QazaqGaz in December 2021, with the total amount of raw gas made available during phase 2A increasing from 3 Bcm/y to 5 Bcm/y, including the 1 Bcm/y Kashagan GPZ. 42 Although cost estimates have not been announced, prior estimates for a 2 Bcm/y GPZ at Kashagan were around $2.6 billion. 43 KMG announced that the tender for the construction of the Zhanaozen GPZ should be completed by the end of September 2023.Table 6.6 Kazakhstan’s gas processing plants Gas processing plants Capacity (Bcm/y) Utilization in 2021 (%) T engiz GPZ 13.0 100% Zhanazhol GPZ 8.4 62% Bolashak GPZ 6.3 84% Chinarevskaya GTU 4.2 16% KazGPZ 1.5 60% Shagyrly GTU 1.3 73% Amangeldy GPZ 0.7 49% Akshabulak GTU 0.6 67% Targabatay GPC 0.6 52% Kozhasay GPC 0.4 100% Alibekmola GTU 0.4 100% Borankol GTU GPZ 0.4 10% Severny Nurzhanov GPZ 0.2 100% Karakuduk GPZ 0.1 26% Arystanovskoe GTU 0.1 44% Vostochny Makat GPZ 0.0 100% EmirOil 0.0 87% Balginbayev S.

This was mainly accomplished with the completion of the first string of the Beyneu-Bozoy-Shymkent (BBS) pipeline in 2015, together with the construction of additional loops and pipeline links, as well as installation of advanced compressor stations. Now all the main gas trunklines of Kazakhstan are connected into a single gas transportation system, including the Soyuz, Central Asia–Center (CAC), Bukhara-Urals, Tashkent-Bishkek-Almaty, and Gazli-Shymkent, as well as the BBS and CAGP pipelines (see Figure 6.15 Kazakhstan’s gas sector (selected key elements) and Table 6.7 Kazakhstan's existing main gas pipelines as of 1 January 2023). The unified system allows Kazakhstan additional security and flexibility in gas operations, including: (1) less dependence on Uzbek gas for its southern regions, which has proved critical since 2018; (2) the possibility for large-volume gas exports to China, which has proved vital for QazaqGaz since 2017; and (3) provision of a gateway for the gasification of areas in central and northern Kazakhstan that previously lacked access to piped natural gas. QazaqGaz is the national gas operator in Kazakhstan for gas exploration, production, transportation, and distribution. Through its subsidiaries, QazaqGaz operates gas pipelines totaling around 76,800 km, including 20,800 km of large-diameter pipelines with an annual throughput capacity of 260 Bcm of gas, and gas distribution networks totaling 65,686 km.

Intergas Central Asia (ICA), a specialized subsidiary of QazaqGaz, owns and operates nearly all of the national trunk gas transmission system and the three main underground storage facilities. 44 The trunk transmission system (20,800 km) carried 93.5 Bcm in 2022, about 10% less than the 103.6 Bcm transported in 2021. Transit gas accounted for the bulk (77%) of the transported flows, while deliveries to domestic consumers accounted for 18% of the total (see Table 6.8 Gas shipments through Kazakhstan's major trunk pipelines). However, operation of the gas transportation infrastructure is constrained by a high degree of deterioration and resultant low throughput capacity. The core of Kazakhstan’s national pipeline infrastructure dates from the Soviet period, with the average wear rate (share of assets needing replacement, having exceeded their designed retirement date) of many pipelines over 70%, according to ICA. The company intends to modernize the gas transmission system and has developed a plan that by 2030 will reduce this level of asset depreciation to 25%. The trilateral agreement to supply Uzbekistan with Russian gas via the Central Asia–Center (CAC) pipeline will necessitate upgrades as well. In 2022, ICA spent 141.4 billion tenge ($313 million) on new infrastructure, including construction of a gas pipeline and compressor station from the Kashagan GPZ to the Makat-North Caucasus gas pipeline and completing construction of the Zhetybay-Kuryk gas pipeline; ICA also spent 26.6 billion tenge ($50 million) on maintenance. At the time of this writing, QazaqGaz had eliminated 22,482 out of 47,912 pipeline defects revealed as a result of the trunk gas pipeline inspections carried out over a period of 5-7 years. QazaqGaz intends to continue this work of eliminating the remaining pipeline defects in accordance with the company’s ongoing capital expenditure plans. ICA operates some of the distribution pipeline networks that carry gas from trunk pipelines to end-consumers, while KTG Aimak, another subsidiary of QazaqGaz, is the entity that is mainly responsible for final gas deliveries to end-users. The expansion of Kazakhstan’s local pipeline distribution networks has been proceeding for over a decade or more, but it has accelerated since 2017. Although most piped gas is still consumed in large population centers along the trunk pipeline routes, significant gasification efforts have added smaller cities, towns, and settlements, dramatically increasing gasification levels. Gasification levels across the country continue to increase. In 2022, about 107 settlements were gasified, bringing the overall gasification level for Kazakhstan to 59%. In 2023, government plans call for gasification of additional 56 rural settlements, bringing gas to an additional 166.6 thousand people and reaching the goal of 60% gasification. 165 In 2023, the length of distribution pipelines in the country totaled over 59,181 km. KTG Aimak also reports that the length of gas distribution pipelines in urban and rural areas (inside the city-gate) has increased by almost 50% between 2017 and 2021, with about 8,555 km added since 2016. The largest distribution networks are in Almaty, Turkestan, Atyrau, and West Kazakhstan oblasts; the largest additions to gas pipeline networks inside the citygate in recent years were in Astana city and Almaty and Kostanay oblasts. KTG Aimak delivered 13.4 Bcm of gas through its distribution pipelines in 2021. T o facilitate the growth of gas consumption and to reach its gasification goals, QazaqGaz is undertaking a number of projects to upgrade, strengthen, and build out gas infrastructure (see Table 6.9 Kazakhstan’s planned/proposed trunk gas pipelines): ►Kashagan connector to Makat–North Caucasus. Construction of a 17 km trunk pipeline from the Kashagan GPZ (planned for 2021-23) to provide an outlet for the processed gas coming from the new 1 Bcm/y plant by QazaqGaz. The pipeline will include a compressor station with potential capacity expansion from 1 Bcm/y to 4 Bcm/y. ►Looping on Makat–North Caucasus. A 130 km looping line to provide reliability of gas supply to the population and large industrial enterprises of Atyrau Oblast (especially to the special economic zone hosting the Atyrau petrochemical plants); expected timeline of the project is 2021-23, with capacity of the looping line at 7.5 Bcm/y; the key source of gas for the new looping line is expected to be the T engiz GPZ via САС. ►Second line of Beyneu-Bozoy-Shymkent pipeline (BBS-2). Construction of BBS-2 aims to maintain export potential and stable gas supply to the southern and central regions of the country;"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_NationalReport23_en_114", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\NationalReport23_en.pdf", "text": "planned capacity of BBS-2 is 10 Bcm/y or more, with a tentatively planned construction completion date of 2027. BBS-2 is intended to supply large new commercial customers in southern and central Kazakhstan, including Almaty TETs-2, ERG, and ArcelorMittal. The pipeline is planned to be constructed by attracting private investment through investment incentives, including “ take- or-pay” contract. In May 2023, at the first Central Asia-China Summit, QazaqGaz and CNPC signed a cooperation agreement that included the construction of BBS-2.►Beyneu-Zhanaozen-2. Construction of the Beyneu- Zhanaozen-2 pipeline is a part of the Okarem-Beyneu trunk pipeline upgrade, intended to augment the existing section, allowing a more reliable gas supply to settlements in Mangystau Oblast, MAEK-Kazatomprom LLP’s power station, and other large enterprises. 45 Aggregate pipeline capacity will increase from 3.1 Bcm/y to 8.9 Bcm/y. Beyneu-Zhanaozen-2 will be supplied with reverse flow gas (flowing from north to south) from CAC. ►Zhanaozen-Aktau. QazaqGaz plans major capital upgrades of the existing three strings of the Zhanaozen-Aktau pipeline. Additionally, construction of a fourth line for the Zhanaozen-Aktau segment, connecting to the Okarem-Beyneu trunk pipeline, is planned and will supply gas to Aktau, Kuryk, and other settlements. Aggregate capacity expansion is planned from 2.7 Bcm/y to 6.1 Bcm/y. ►Bukhara–Urals pipeline to Aktobe. Construction of a third spur from the Bukhara–Urals pipeline to Aktobe is intended to provide additional gas supply to meet rising demand in Aktobe city and nearby settlements. Construction is planned for 2022-23, with a pipeline capacity of 2.4 Bcm/y and an estimated capex of 43.4 billion tenge ($96 million). The first two spurs from the Bukhara-Urals pipeline to Aktobe are reported to be nearly worn out. ►Zhanazhol-Aktobe pipeline 2. Construction of a second string of the Zhanazhol-Aktobe pipeline is also being considered. T o date, Aktobe is supplied with gas from two trunk gas pipelines—Zhanazhol-Aktobe (0.9 Bcm/y) and Bukhara-Urals (3.2 Bcm/y); Aktobe’s city administration has long been eager to increase gas supply to the city and to alleviate concerns about supply from the aging Bukhara-Urals pipeline. Estimated capex for the Zhanazhol-Aktobe pipeline 2 is 120.3 billion tenge ($267 million). In addition to the projects formally announced by QazaqGaz, discussions between Kazakhstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan regarding the creation a regional gas supply framework could lead to the expansion of existing Kazakh gas transportation capacity or even the construction of entirely new pipelines. 45 Kazakhstan’s section of the Okarem–Beyneu (CAC-3) pipeline (commissioned in 1976) is one of the more worn-out gas pipelines according to QazaqGaz, with a wear rate greater than 75%. QazaqGaz plans major capital upgrades on this string of the pipeline system.Table 6.8 Gas shipments through Kazakhstan’s major trunk pipelines (Bcm/y) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Total gas transportation via pipelines 119.8 104.1 117.5 125.4 111.2 89.6 103.6 93.5 ICA pipelines 84.0 66.8 76.6 80.134 73.0 57.8 65.2 54.7 Domestic deliveries 11.5 12.3 12.9 13.6 13.7 14.3 15.8 16.8 Export 12.7 13.3 16.7 18.9 19.1 12.7 8.5 4.9 International transit (ICA) 59.7 41.2 46.9 47.7 40.2 30.8 40.8 32.9 Russian transit (Russia-Russia) 53.1 37.0 41.4 43.9 30.7 25.7 30.8 29.1 Central Asian transit to Russia 6.6 4.3 5.5 3.8 8.9 3.8 9.0 2.3 Uzbek transit (Uzbek-Uzbek) 0.1 - - - 0.6 1.3 1.0 1.1 Russian gas to Kyrgystan - 0.4 CAGP transit (total) 35.9 37.3 40.9 45.3 38.3 31.9 38.5 38.9 Source: S&P Global, ICA. © 2023 S&P Global. 166 Table 6.9 Kazakhstan’s planned/proposed trunk gas pipelines (as of 1 August 2023) Estimated total pipeline length (km) on Kazakh territoryEstimated throughput capacity (Bcm/y)CAPEX (bln, KZT w/o VAT)Expected commisioning or construction start-up dateDocuments Preliminary status Aktobe-Bukhara–Ural third line 165 2.4 43.4 2023Presentation of the Minister of Energy for the Majilis*In process Zhetybay-Kuryk, with AGRS-80 installation in Kuryk 85 22.9 2022Kazakhstan’s Comprehensive Plan for the Gas Industry**Commissioned in 2022 Zhanazhol-Aktobe second line 244 120.3 2025Presentation of the Minister of Energy for the Majilis*Planned Okarem-Beyneu, line 2 473 Annual report 2022 ICA In process Beyneu–Zhanaozen, line 2 308 5.8 160.8 2023Kazakhstan’s Comprehensive Plan for the Gas Industry**In process Zhanaozen-Aktau, line 4 428 4.5 27.5 2023Presentation of the Minister of Energy for the Majilis*In process Beyneu–Bozoy–Shymkent, line 2 1,450 15.0 160.8 2026-2027Kazakhstan’s Comprehensive Plan for the Gas Industry**Development of project documentation Looping on Makat–North Caucasus 130 13.1 89.1 2023Kazakhstan’s Comprehensive Plan for the Gas Industry**In process Kashagan gas processing plant (GPZ)-Makat–North Caucasus 17 1.0 71.9 2023 Invest program ICA In process Almaty-Bayserke-Talgar, line 2 64.0 1.5 2023 Annual report 2022 ICA Development of project documentation SaryArka, Phase II and Phase III 483 188.5 n/aPresentation of the Minister of Energy for the Majilis*n/a Barnaul-Rubtsovsk-Semey-Ust-Kamenogorsk-Pavlodar 679 n/aPresentation of the Minister of Energy for the Majilis*n/a Kostanay-Astana-Pavlodar-Semey-Ust-Kamenogorskn/aPresentation of the Minister of Energy***n/a Omsk-Pavlodar-Semey-Ust-Kamenogorskn/aPresentation of the Minister of Energy***n/a Ishim-Petropavlosk-Kokshetau-Astana 644 n/aPresentation of the Minister of Energy for the Majilis*n/a Notes: *Presentation of the Minister of Energy for the Majilis on the prospects for the development of the gas market, June 2022. **Kazakhstan’s Comprehensive Plan for the Development of the Gas Industry for 2022–2026.***Presentation of the Minister of Energy about results of 2022 and plans for 2023.Source: S&P Global, QazaqGaz, ICA. © 2023 S&P Global. 167 6.8.1 Gas transit Because of its geographic location, Kazakhstan is still an important transit country, with externally-sourced gas moving across Kazakh territory to third countries, including from Central Asia to Russia and China; from Russia to itself, and also to Kyrgyzstan; and from Uzbekistan to itself (moving across Kazakhstan to supply the Uzbek capital of Tashkent) (see Table 6.8). Transit gas has always taken up the largest share of the gas moved through the country’s trunk pipeline system. As a consequence, transit revenues are an important source of revenue for the national operator. For over a decade, transit volumes have been in the range of 78-95 Bcm/y. In 2022, an aggregate of 71.8 Bcm of gas transited Kazakhstan, a 10% decline compared to 2021. The decline is largely associated with the lower volume of Turkmen gas transit going to Russia. 46 In 2022, transit to China amounted to 38.9 Bcm or 54% of total"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_NationalReport23_en_115", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\NationalReport23_en.pdf", "text": "transit; Russian gas transit accounted for 29.1 Bcm, or 41%; and Central Asian gas transit to Russia accounted for only 3% of the transit volumes, a marked difference from the years past, when this category accounted for about 50% of gas transited. Going forward, transit flows will remain the largest component of the total gas flowing in Kazakhstan’s pipeline system, with the bulk being Central Asian transit volumes flowing eastward across Kazakhstan to China via the CAGP system. A new transit flow, of Russian gas south to Uzbekistan, is slated to begin later in 2023. 6.8.2 Gas supply dilemma for north-central and eastern Kazakhstan: Extension of SaryArka pipeline or Russian imported gas? A key component of Kazakhstan’s overall gasification strategy, and its efforts to reduce GHG emissions as part of its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, is to extend the natural gas transportation network to areas not presently able to access pipeline gas. Major unserved regions are located in north-central and eastern Kazakhstan. For gasification of these areas, the government is now considering three options for gas supply: ►Domestic gas: Extending the SaryArka pipeline from Astana to Kokshetau (phase 2) and then to Petropavlovsk (phase 3); this would involve a total capex of 185 billion tenge ($420 million); the pipeline length would be 483 km. ►Imported Russian gas: Russian gas could be brought in via one or more new pipelines: Ishim-Petropavlovsk-Kokshetau-Astana, with total length of 644 km. This pipeline is the least ambitious of three proposed lines, supplying the capital and two major northern cities en route. Barnaul-Rubtsovsk-Semey-Oskemen pipeline (with a spur to Pavlodar). The pipeline from Barnaul to East Kazakhstan and Pavlodar oblasts is expected to supply gas to ~2.1 million people, supporting 2.3 Bcm/y of consumption. The project will require construction of new infrastructure not only in Kazakhstan, but also in Russia. On Russian territory, the pipeline would have to be built from Barnaul to the Russia-Kazakh border; additional capacity would be needed to move more gas from Surgut to Novosibirsk and then to Barnaul, as the existing pipelines are currently operating at capacity. 47 In February 2023, the Ministry of Energy of Kazakhstan announced that it is considering a third option for the gasification of the eastern part of Kazakhstan, which would include building a gas pipeline along the route Kostanay-Astana-Pavlodar- Semey-Oskemen, with the potential for Russian gas exports onward to China. ►Hybrid (Russian-Kazakh) gas supply: Kazakhstan’s Energy Ministry also is considering an even more all-encompassing proposal for gasification of the north-central and eastern regions—looping the main Saryarka gas pipeline together with a Russian gas pipeline entering the region. Gazprom is currently conducting a pre-feasibility study of the project for the determination of the most economical route. The estimated cost of this project falls within the range of KZT 1.9-2 trillion ($4.4 billion), with the capacity to supply up to 40 Bcm/y. 48 6.9 Domestic Gas Consumption 6.9.1 Kazakhstan’s gasification program In 2015 Kazakhstan embarked on a herculean 15-year gasification endeavor, designed to make piped natural gas available to millions of its people for the first time. 49 A key social project, it is a largely government-funded program aimed at raising domestic gas consumption, mainly by households. This is intended (in part) to help the country meet its emissions reduction goals under the Paris Climate Accord. The overall initiative reached its 2030 gasification goal of 56% nine years ahead of schedule, in 2021 (see Figure 6.16 Kazakhstan’s gasification levels and 2030 targets). However, due to the sharp increase in domestic gas consumption in recent years and the need to modernize the gas transmission system to ensure 46 Turkmenistan’s exports to Russia evidently declined from 10.6 Bcm in 2021 to 3.4 Bcm in 2022, or by 66.8%.47 Construction of a small spur pipeline from Barnaul to Rebrikha (en route to Rubtsovsk) was completed in December 2021; Gazprom spent 2 billion rubles ($27.8 million) constructing the pipeline. Construction initially started on this pipeline in 2016, but was halted due to contractor issues; Gazprom resumed construction of the gas pipeline in mid-2020 after securing a new contractor “Tomskgazstroy.” As part of Russian gasification program 2025-30, Gazprom plans to extend this pipeline from Rebrikha to Rubtsovsk via Aleysk. 48 The capacity figure is planned to accommodate Kazakh domestic demand as well as potential exports to China. 49 In late 2014, the Government of Kazakhstan approved the official “General Gasification Scheme of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2015-30” (“Gasification Scheme”), codifying its long-held ambitions to expand the availability of piped gas in the country. 168 uninterrupted gas supply, the Ministry of Energy (together with QazaqGaz) updated the General Gasification Scheme in 2022. As a result, a new gasification goal was set at 65% for 2030. The Scheme reinforced Kazakhstan’s commitment to further gasification of the residential sector and industry. 50 In 2022, the aggregate gasification level in Kazakhstan reached 59%. The gasification program is funded mainly by national and local governments as well the national operator and other (private) sources. Over past five years, the gasification program has largely been focused on the construction of regional gasification facilities and low-pressure distribution pipelines. This activity is being 80-90% financed from the republican budget; meanwhile, funding for design and for the construction of the intra-settlement gas pipelines comes from the local (oblast-level) governments. In its 2022 annual report, QazaqGaz stated that it does not participate in the construction of small distribution pipelines inside the city-gate, but connects consumers to the larger gas network after being notified of their readiness. 51 The national company already has spent over 112 billion KZT (about $293 million) of its own funds on gasification during 2014-19. 52 QazaqGaz planned to spend an additional 14.3 billion tenge ($32 million) on regional gas transportation to facilitate gasification plans during 2021-23. In 2022, consumer gas connection prices were unreasonably high. KTG Aimak’s total price for consumer connection/gasification was 596,000 tenge versus 918,000 tenge in the competitive market. In order to incentivize competition and fair pricing in"}

Based on 2022 results, KTG Aimak managed to carry out construction and installation works at about 566 residential buildings or 9% of the total number of newly gasified residential buildings (6,301; including 5,286 in Astana city and 1,015 in Karaganda Oblast). It is noteworthy that KTG Aimak carried out these construction and installation works at zero margin. Gasification projects carried out by QazaqGaz subsidiary, KTG- Aimak, are financed through Samruk-Kazyna Trust, which is Samruk-Kazyna’s foundation for financing social development projects. The Trust finances most of the gasification activities of Samruk-Kazyna companies. KTG-Aimak, in line with its responsibilities as a gas distributor, covers expenses associated with connecting consumers to its larger gas distribution system. 53 The Ministry of Energy reported that in 2022 funds allocated for gasification projects from the republican budget reached 96.1 billion tenge ($213 million), doubling in size compared to 2021 and quintupling compared to 2018. The 2022 funds were spent on 142 gas projects, which were implemented across 107 rural settlements and provided gas to an estimated 285,000 people, according to the Ministry. 54 In 2023, gasification levels are set to reach 60% with budgetary allocations reaching 74 billion tenge ($164 million) to gasify 56 rural settlements, reaching 167,000 people. The priority accorded to gasification projects aligns with the priorities of the Kazakh government as outlined in the ruling party’s “Amanat” roadmap. The Amanat program calls for providing natural gas to residents of Astana, Karaganda, Kokshetau, Oskemen, Pavlodar, Petropavlovsk, and Semey cities by 2025 (step 247 of the program). The second relevant gasification goal (step 278) calls for ensuring gas access by 2025 to 246 villages with a total population of more than 900,000 people. By 2023 progress is significantly ahead of these gasification goals. 50 The updated Gasification Scheme proposes to introduce digital technology along the gas delivery networks as well as at delivery points and gas metering devices. 51 The Gasification Scheme clarifies that the decision on financing is made in accordance with the corporate rules for considering investment projects of the national operator. An estimated amount available for gasification financing is calculated based on the wholesale price of marketable gas, taking into account the national operator’s profit margin of 5% during 2016-21 and 10% during 2022-30. 52 During 2010-20, QazaqGaz constructed more than 9,500 km of gas distribution networks.53 In its 2022 annual report QazaqGaz revealed that its prices for connecting households directly to the gas network (at the domestic gas network level) were significantly lower than those of its private competitors. In 2023, KREM analyzed and deemed that KTG Aimak should not participate in construction and installation work for in-house gas networks after all. This is likely due to availability of other companies to perform this work and also to this activity not being KTG Aimak’s primary competency or core responsibility. 54 During 2010-20, the state budget funded over 1,300 gasification projects and construction of more than 18,000 km of gas distribution networks across the country.Figure 6.16 Kazakhstan’s gasification levels and 2030 targets (%) Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global . 169 6.9.2 Historical gas consumption In 2022, end-of-pipe consumption (deliveries to consumers) reached 19.3 Bcm, a 4% increase over 2021 (see Table 6.4 and Figure 6.17 Natural gas consumption in Kazakhstan by oblast, 2014-22). 55 Gasification was an important driver behind the robust growth seen in end-user demand, with residential consumption rising by 8% year on year to 5.2 Bcm in 2022. Power sector gas demand rose sharply in 2021, by 22% to 11.5 Bcm, according to Kazakhstan’s Statistical Bureau. Although demand in this sector declined by 7%, to 10.5 Bcm, in 2022, consumption was still quite high, particularly compared to historical numbers. In fact, the level of gas use in the power sector in 2022 was 14% higher than in 2020. Gas demand over the past two years was likely boosted by the need to deploy additional gas-fired power generation to meet the rising need for flexible generation. 56 Industrial gas demand (excluding power), however, declined by about 7% in 2022, reaching 3.7 Bcm in total. 57 For the first half of 2023, end-of-pipe gas consumption rose by 3.9%. According to QazaqGaz, in the early months of 2023, Kazakhstan’s peak gas demand reached an all-time high of 4.1 MMcm per hour (100 MMcm/d), which is 17.1% higher than in 2022. This was likely due to a colder than average winter. The relative structure of gas consumption among the major sectors has remained broadly stable over time, even as the overall volume has increased. Of the total amount of gas sold to 55 Other statistical sources (national energy balances) indicate that deliveries to consumers amounted to 18.3 Bcm in 2022. In 2022, we calculate total apparent consumption of natural gas in Kazakhstan (defined as commercial production minus exports plus imports) as 30.4 Bcm; other statistical sources indicate that this was 21.5 Bcm. The difference between apparent and end-of-pipe consumption represents other domestic disappearance, including field and processing losses, pipeline use, changes in stocks, etc.56 In particular gas consumption in Zhambyl Oblast increased from 1.8 Bcm in 2021 to 2.3 Bcm in 2022, likely reflecting greater use at the Zhambyl power station, where electricity generation increased by 18.2% in 2021 and 70% in 2022. 57 This includes both at the end of the pipe (1.9 Bcm) and well as by the oil and gas industry at production sites. Within industry the largest consumers are ferrous metallurgy at 0.4 Bcm and chemicals (including feedstocks) at 0.6 Bcm in 2022; the oil and gas industry itself used 1.8 Bcm. 58 The first LNG mobile filling station was opened in Akmola Oblast in 2021 as a joint project between Kazakhstan, Russia, and China to support the New Silk Road initiative. There was also a mobile LNG station in Astana during EXPO-2017. The capital also has one LNG re-gasification station, with"}

The use of gas in road transportation, including compressed natural gas (CNG) in municipal buses or light vehicles, or liquified natural gas (LNG) in trucking, amounted to only 3.5 MMcm in 2022. LNG use has effectively made no measurable progress in recent years. 58 Similarly, CNG is consumed only in niche transportation segments. As of the end of 2022, 21 CNG stations operated in Kazakhstan, of which 10 belong to QazaqGaz, 1 station in Almaty belongs to the municipal bus fleet, and the remaining 10 CNG stations belong to private enterprises. Southern Kazakhstan has the largest number of CNG stations in the country. The total number of vehicles running on CNG in Kazakhstan at the end of 2022 was 2,123, according to QazaqGaz. The volume of CNG supplied to refueling stations for own use by enterprises with vehicle fleets swelled from 157 m 3 in 2016 to 11.9 MMcm in 2017,Figure 6.17 Natural gas consumption in Kazakhstan by oblast, 2014-22 (MMcm/y) Source: S&P Global, Ministry of Energy RK. © 2023 S&P Global. 170 before declining to only 2.2 MMcm in 2020. Recorded retail sales of CNG amounted to 209.4 Mcm in 2016, peaked in 2018 at 1.3 MMcm, and fell to 891 Mcm in 2020. QazaqGaz reported that it supplied about 55 MMcm of CNG to refueling stations (in Almaty, Aktobe, and Rudnyy) in 2022, up from 42.2 MMcm in 2020. The original set of measures to expand the use of natural gas as motor fuel was outlined in a resolution for 2019-22, approved by Government Decree No.797 dated 29 November 2018. However, plans to develop CNG/LNG infrastructure have progressed quite slowly given sufficient availability of traditional refined products on the market at attractive prices. In 2022, QazaqGaz reported that it initiated an extension to the 2018 resolution to increase natural gas a motor fuel to 2027. QazaqGaz set several goals it intends to achieve by 2027; these include: ►increasing CNG sales to 289 MMcm by 2027 ►increasing the number of CNG vehicles to 3,830 ►increasing the number of CNG stations to 35 ►and increasing the number of LNG plants to 2. The company states that it hopes to replace 218,000 tons of diesel fuel with natural gas and save about 31 billion tenge ($69 million) in fuel expenses. 59 Concerns about the tightening gas balance and the need to rely on imports has raised energy security concerns among policymakers, as excessive dependence on gas imports may render important projects and infrastructure in the country 59 See QazaqGaz Annual Report 2022, p. 141. 60 In March 2023, President T okayev instructed the Government to develop an Energy Efficiency and Rational Consumption of Commercial Gas Plan.Figure 6.18 Kazakhstan’s natural gas consumption outlook by sector to 2050 (Bcm) Notes: End-of-pipe consumption; transport excludes pipelines; domestic sector is residential-commercial-municipal.

Although an understandable concern, many gas-importing nations realize the importance of multiple sources for gas imports and usefulness of gas storage (see Chapter 2). Another initiative, spearheaded by the Ministry of Energy along with the Ministry of National Economy and QazaqGaz, focuses on a demand management approach and calls for adoption and implementation of a plan for Energy Efficiency and Rational Consumption of Commercial Gas (the Energy Efficiency for Gas Plan). 60 The plan proposes to implement energy efficiency measures such as a differentiated gas tariff for residential consumers, optimization of temperature standards during the heating season, switching to reserve fuels (coal), and others. The Energy Efficiency for Gas Plan for 2023-25 proposes the flowing initiatives: ►Reduction in losses in the pipeline network ►Creation of a centralized gas metering system (digitalization of gas transmission and gas distribution systems) ►The introduction of commercial gas consumption allowances for households in each region, taking into account average weather conditions ►Increasing the overall efficiency of the fuel and energy complex. The Ministry estimates that these measures could save 2.5 Bcm/y of gas without a negative impact on economic activity in Kazakhstan. In terms of regional consumption, S&P Global identifies five regional gas-consuming “markets” in Kazakhstan, determined by such factors as sources of gas supply (indigenous production or imports) and the configuration of the national gas pipeline system. The five broadly identifiable regional gas “markets” 171 or zones are (see Figure 6.19 Kazakhstan’s domestic gas consumption (end-of-pipe) in 2022 and outlook to 2050 by consumption zone): ►The western zone, which includes Mangystau, Atyrau, and West Kazakhstan oblasts ►The southern zone, which includes Turkestan Oblast and Shymkent city, Almaty Oblast and Almaty city, and Zhambyl and Kyzylorda oblasts ►The northwestern zone, which includes Aktobe and Kostanay oblasts ►The north-central zone, a nascent gas-consuming area that is only now receiving piped gas for the first time, comprising Astana city, North Kazakhstan Oblast, Akmola Oblast, Pavlodar Oblast, and Karaganda Oblast ►The eastern zone, which encompasses East Kazakhstan and Abay oblasts, with current consumption currently organizedaround a small producing (Sarybulak) gas field that also traditionally exported gas to China. The western zone, where much of Kazakhstan’s gas production is concentrated, historically had high gasification levels and consumption, with gas used in power generation, industry, and the residential-commercial segment. Gasification levels in western Kazakhstan rank among the highest in the country, reaching well over 90% of its population (see Figure 6.20 Gasification levels in Kazakhstan by oblast). Consumption in western Kazakhstan amounted to 6.7 Bcm in 2022, or 35% of national end-of-pipe consumption. Oblasts in southern Kazakhstan absorbed 8.0 Bcm in 2022 (45% of consumption), while the northwestern zone consumed about 4.4 Bcm of gas in 2022 (23% of consumption)."}

S&P Global is impartial and not an authority on international boundaries which might be subject to unresolved claims by multiple jurisdictions. 6.9.3 Gas consumption outlook for Kazakhstan By 2050, S&P Global envisions national gas consumption (end- of-pipe deliveries) will reach around 33.2 Bcm (see Table 6.5, Figure 6.18, and Figure 6.21 Outlook for Kazakhstan’s gas consumption by region). Gas use in the economy is expected to largely backfill for declining coal consumption rather than represent net additions to primary energy consumption. By 2050 the electric power sector is expected to consume almost 20 Bcm (60%) of gas demand. Between 2022 and 2030, gas demand in the segment increases by about 1.7 Bcm, but grows more rapidly post-2030, reaching 17.2 Bcm in 2040 and 19.9 Bcm in 2050. In S&P Global’s outlook for electric power generation, thermal generation (mainly from coal and gas, but also a bit of refined products) peaks in 2025 at 104.4 billion kWh and broadly declines to 87.4 billion kWh by 2050, with the share of thermal generation in the overall total decreasing from 89% in 2022 to 61% in 2050. The composition of thermal generation changes, with gas use increasing and coal decreasing. If in 2022, gas accounts for about 23% of thermal generation, then by 2050 it reaches over 51%. Meanwhile, the share of coal in thermal generation declines from 75% in 2022 to under 48% in 2050. Gas consumption in the industrial sector, primarily in mining and manufacturing (including petrochemicals), is also likely to grow, albeit at a more modest pace. Policy support for coal to gas switching, which is currently focused on power generation, could emerge for the industrial sector in the future. Currently, many heavy industrial processes in Kazakhstan are still geared towards coal. Residential-commercial gas consumption is expected to reach 9.8 Bcm in 2050, growing at a robust 1.6% per year on average during 2023-50. The growth is expected from new gasification projects as well as from higher usage by the current consumer base. 173 The use of gas in road transportation is likely to see some expansion across the country, although the segment has developed at a fairly languid pace in recent years. 61 By 2050, road transportation is expected to consume about 0.5 Bcm of gas per year. The updated gasification Scheme as well as the Gas Industry Development Plan to 2026 both mention the need for government subsidies to encourage development of natural gas as a motor fuel and as an alternative gasification approach to piped gasification via re-gasification terminals in East Kazakhstan and Abay oblasts. The idea of building re-gas stations to support regional gasification remains largely hypothetical in our outlook. 6.10 Expansion of Kazakhstan’s Gas–Based Petrochemical Industry 6.10.1 Kazakhstan’s gas-based feedstocks for gas-chemicals Kazakhstan has access to ample gas-type feedstocks that can be utilized for petrochemical production. The country benefits from 61 See Chapter 5.3.2. Use of natural gas in transportation and other potential uses for natural gas in The National Energy Report 2017. Figure 6.21 Outlook for Kazakhstan’s gas consumption by region (MMcm) Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global . an abundant oil and gas resource base, and petrochemical producers in the country also have access to many other minerals — such as salts for chlor-alkali production — that are also important raw materials. Despite the sizable presence of natural gas (methane) in the country, it is in relatively short supply commercially because of rising domestic needs for this clean fuel and the widespread use of gas reinjection to enhance oil recovery. Thus, it is difficult to foresee a substantial expansion of methane-based petrochemical production (e.g., ammonia, nitrogenous fertilizers, methanol) given the lack of commercial gas supply. Kazakhstan does have an ample supply of low-cost NGLs such as ethane, propane, and butane that can be used as feedstocks for petrochemical development, however. This is the approach being taken in the development of the Atyrau integrated gas-chemical complex. But there are some ongoing initiatives in the methane chain that are being pursued, particularly by KazAzot, which has its own gas production and is looking at alternative gas monetization options other than sales to QazaqGaz as fuel (see below). 174 6.10.1.1 Atyrau integrated gas-chemical complex, phase 1: Kazakhstan’s world-class polypropylene plant starts up The launch of a new polypropylene plant, located at Karabatan near Atyrau in western Kazakhstan, in November 2022 by Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries Inc. (KPI) signals the start of a new era for Kazakhstan and its petrochemical industry. 62 The government has long promoted ambitious plans, dating back nearly two decades, to create a major gas-based petrochemical industry in the country, based on its feedstock-rich gas. The large new plant, with a capacity of 500,000 metric tons of polypropylene per year, is viewed only as the initial phase (Phase 1) of an overall scheme to build a large integrated petrochemical complex at the site (integrated gas-chemical complex [IGCC]). The second phase involves the launch of a large"}

Plans also call for other related products, such as ethyl benzene, ethylene glycol, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyvinyl chloride, to be added eventually. The site has its own power plant, with a current capacity of 310 MW, with a planned expansion for an additional 160 MW. 63 Groundbreaking for the polypropylene plant took place in 2009, as it was originally scheduled to start up in 2012–13. The project was repeatedly delayed by a number of factors, including changing project parameters and partners. 64 Serious construction, however, really only got underway in 2017 and was finally completed at the end of 2021, with the overall commissioning process beginning in early 2022. Propane was first delivered to the plant for processing in July 2022, when the plant was connected to the electricity grid. On 18 November 2022, the plant dispatched its initial shipment of 1,500 metric tons of polypropylene, which was for export. For 2022 as a whole, KPI shipped a total of 32,300 metric tons of polypropylene from the new plant. 65 The new plant employs a propane dehydration (PDH) unit to produce propylene, using CB&I Lummus BV’s catofin technology to convert propane into propylene. Lummus T echnology LLC’s Novolen gas-phase technology turns the propylene into polypropylene, producing up to 500,000 metric tons annually. The propane feedstock is supplied by TCO. It is Kazakhstan’s 66 After initial plans were announced for the construction of the first two polymer plants, progress remained very slow. Because of the slow progress, management of construction was handed over to KMG in July 2018 under a trust management agreement with SK, which owns both SKO (then known as UCC) and KMG. In June 2022, upon completion of the construction phase, SK transferred a 49.5% stake in KPI to KMG as payment for the latter’s services. 67 However, up to 20% of the plant’s output (100,000 t/y) is slated to go to the domestic market. The Ministry of Energy estimates that current domestic consumption is about 50,000 metric tons, so it envisions very high growth in domestic consumption in the coming years.largest oil producer by far, with a large associated gas output; it is also Kazakhstan’s largest producer of LPGs (propane and butane). TCO’s total supply obligation is for up to 550,000 metric tons of propane annually. Propane deliveries occur under a contract signed in September 2021 between TCO and KPI. Another company, PTC Holding LLP, is the operator responsible for the transportation of propane to the plant as well as the dispatch of polypropylene from the plant. Currently, propane is delivered to the plant by rail. The propane is pumped from the arriving railcars to a tank storage farm that consists of four storage tanks. At full operation, this will involve the arrival of 10,500 railcars per year. KPI’s contract with PTC Holding is through 2026; after 2027 the propane is slated to be supplied through a 205 km pipeline, extending from the T engiz field to the Karabatan site. The Karabatan site is set up as a special economic zone, known as the National Industrial Petrochemical T echnopark (NIPT). Karabatan is located 33 km northeast of the city of Atyrau, with the actual site being 8-9 km north of the Karabatan rail station. The project developer and operator is KPI Inc., currently structured as a JV between KMG (49.5%), SKO (49.5%), and Firm Almex Plus LLP (1%). 66 The total capex for the polypropylene plant was $2.63 billion, including $1.87 billion for engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC). The main source of funding was a $2 billion loan from the China Development Bank, with the general contractor being China National Chemical Engineering Co. Ltd (CNCEC). Currently, the plant is capable of producing 11 types of polypropylene, which so far have been primarily directed to the export market. 67 The plant is projected to eventually produce more than 65 different grades of polypropylene. Export shipments are carried out under a contract with Russia’s PJSC SIBUR Holding, while domestic market sales are handled by KPI itself. When reaching full capacity, the distribution of international sales is planned to be China (170,000 t/y), Turkey (90,000 t/y), and European countries (50,000 t/y), with the remaining output going to other markets such as Russia, Belarus, Uzbekistan, and Southeast Asia. Following several years of searching for another international partner for the project and several months of negotiations with SIBUR (PJSC SIBUR Holding), Russia’s largest petrochemical company, in October 2021 KMG, SK, and SIBUR concluded a general agreement setting out the conditions for the entry of SIBUR into the project, subject to obtaining all regulatory approvals. In November 2022, KMG and SIBUR created a JV, Silleno LLP, that allows SIBUR to enter both Phase 1 (polypropylene) and Phase 2 (polyethylene), with a 40% stake in each project. 62 KPI is a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna Ondeu LLP (SKO), previously known as United Chemical Company LLP (UCC). This state company was formed in 2009 specifically to implement petrochemical projects in the country. SKO is wholly owned by Kazakhstan’s sovereign welfare fund, Samruk Kazyna (SK). On 3 February 2022, UCC re-registered and changed its name to SKO. 63 The construction of the СCGT power plant was completed in November 2019 by Karabatan Utility Solutions LLP (KUS). KUS operates in trust management for Samruk-Kazyna Construction JSC (joint-stock company). Its task is to build production infrastructure for the overall petrochemical complex, such as for electricity and high-pressure steam. The new CCGT plant consists of four gas turbines and two steam turbines; it is designed to operate on two types of fuel, either natural gas (supplied by the Makat-North Caucasus trunk pipeline) or propane-butane mix as a reserve option during periods when gas might not be available. T otal capex for the plant was 111.2 billion tenge ($244 million). 64 One major hindrance was the withdrawal of LyondellBasell Industries NV as a shareholder in the project in 2010. 65 See the KMG Annual Report for 2022. 175 6.10.1.2 Legacy petrochemical production in Kazakhstan Kazakhstan does have several previously"}

S&P Global is impartial and not an authority on international boundaries which might be subject to unresolved claims by multiple jurisdictions. 6.10.2 Kazakhstan’s general strategy for petrochemical development The Atyrau integrated gas-chemical project at Karabatan is of considerable importance to Kazakhstan because it is hoped to be a key catalyst in the diversification of the hydrocarbon sector from a purely resource extraction position through more “valued-added” processing. In 2022, the chemical industry (together with rubber and resins) accounted for a mere 2.7% of the aggregate value of the country’s industrial output, and therefore less than 1% of aggregate GDP. This is a very small share compared with other middle-income developing countries, especially for a major hydrocarbon producer such as Kazakhstan. Over recent decades, the chemical industry, which is research and capital intensive, has been one of the most dynamic industrial sectors globally, accounting for a rising share of overall value-added, often developing important links to other sectors of the economy, creating a high multiplier effect on overall economic growth. The first official government program for the development of the petrochemical industry was for 2004–10. It envisioned the creation of an integrated cluster of world-class petrochemical industries with deep processing of hydrocarbon raw materials and the production of a wide range of competitive petrochemical products. This is when the National Industrial Petrochemical T echnopark Special Economic Zone at Karabatan was created. A more recent program is the petrochemical program issued in October 2020, envisioning about $15 billion in capital outlays to build several regional clusters, not just in Atyrau, but also in Aktobe, Mangystau, West Kazakhstan, Turkestan, and Zhambyl oblasts. The medium-term target was to complete five major petroleum facilities by 2025. In its most recent annual report on energy sector developments, the Ministry of Energy noted that Kazakhstan produced a total of 271,400 metric tons of petrochemicals in 2022, with a plan to produce 515,000 metric tons in 2023. Obviously, the launch and ramp-up of the new polypropylene plant will play a prominent role in the envisioned petrochemical sector expansion this year (see Table 6.11 Kazakhstan’s planned petrochemical plants). Longer term, the volume of petrochemical products is expected to reach 1.126 MMt by 2024, 1.128 MMt by 2025, and 1.2 MMt by 2026. 177 Operator/ companyProject typeCapacity (t/y)Feedstock sourceLocation Estimated project cost*Commis- sioning year KMG PetroChemethylene/ polyethylene1.25 MMt/yethane from 9.1 Bcm/y Atyrau refinery gas separation unitAtyrau Oblast$7.6 billion 2028 Butadienbutadiene rubber187,000 butadiene rubber 380,000 t/y of butane from TCOAtyrau Oblast$1 billion 2026 KazAzotammonia and urea660,000 ammonia; 577,500 urea; 395,000 weak nitric acid; 500,000 ammonium nitratenatural gas from KazAzot's Shagyrly- Shomyshty fieldMangystau Oblast$1 billion2022- 2026 Kazphosphate ammophos 500,000 ammophosphosphate rock and ammoniaZhambyl Oblast$16 million 2023 Zhaik Petroleum methanol 130,000 methanolnatural gas and carbon dioxideWest- Kazakhstan Oblast$140 million 2024 Zhaik Petroleum ammonia and urea40,000 ammonia; 100,000 ureanatural gasWest- Kazakhstan Oblast$200 million 2029 Westgasoil Pte olefins 800,000 olefins natural gasAtyrau Oblast$1.8 billion 2027 Almex Polymer polypropylene 80,000 polypropylenerefinery fluxesShymkent city$89.2 million 2025 Almex Petrochemicalterephthalic acid/ polyethylene terephthalate600,000 terephthalic acid 430,000 polyethylene terephthalateparaxylene from Atyrau refineryAtyrau Oblast$1 billion 2026 Notes: *Converted from reported tenge costs as prevailing exchange rate of the period.

In 2022, SIBUR entered into the polyethylene project with the creation of the Silleno JV (the project operator).

However, several issues remain outstanding. First, while discussions between TCO and KMG PetroChem have continued, and the two parties have signed an agreement on the basic conditions for the design of a GSU, fundamental questions over gas pricing and procurement arrangements have yet to be fully resolved. Nonetheless, TCO and KMG PetroChem continue to work together on formulating the technical project documents. Phase 2 will likely continue to gain momentum, especially after commissioning of Phase 1 and the imminent launch of TCO’s Future Growth Project – Wellhead Pressure Management Project (FGP-WPMP) later in 2023. The operation of Phase 1 provides the essential “proof of concept” for future petrochemicals expansion in Kazakhstan. 73 Butadiene at Atyrau Another petrochemical project for which development is fairly well advanced is butadiene production. This is also based in the Karabatan T echnopark, but involves an entirely different production chain. This project is being developed by Russia’s PJSC Tatneft (holding a 75% stake) initially together with KMG, and later with Samruk-Kazyna (25%). 74 The planned capacity of the plant is 180,000 t/y of butadiene rubber. The preliminary cost of the project is estimated at $916 million, with an expected completion date of 2026. The feedstock, 380,000 t/y of butane, is planned to come from TCO. 75 The final product — butadiene — is planned to be used to produce tires at the new KamaTyresKZ LLP tire plant in Karaganda Oblast, and the marketing plan also includes some exports to markets including Europe, Russia, China, and Turkey. Construction and installation work was already well underway at the end of 2022. 76 T echnology for the project includes the iC4 CATOFIN®, CATADIENE®, CDMtbe®, and BASF SE’s butadiene production72 The National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan, established in 2000, is the sovereign wealth (oil) fund. 73 Transportation costs for the final product remain a major stumbling block for overall project economics and netbacks.

The second licensing agreement is for the second polymerization unit, also with an annual capacity of 625,000 metric tons. This was signed on 27 December 2022, between KMG and Univation T echnologies LLC. The second agreement covers the provision of Univation’s polyethylene polymerization catalyst systems, including catalysts for high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE). The funding structure for the polyethylene project is still in flux, but is expected to be a combination of debt (loans) and the partner’s own funds. The final products are planned to be sold both on the domestic market and for export, including to China, Turkey, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and European countries. Estimated domestic polyethylene market demand was about 160,000-180,000 t/y but increased to 229,000 metric tons in 2022, while domestic production is negligible (see Table 6.12 Kazakhstan’s polyethylene balance (primary forms), 2015–22). In addition to two polymerization lines, Phase 2 calls for the construction of a $1 billion, 9 Bcm/y gas separation unit (GSU) that would extract 1.5-1.7 MMt/y of ethane and 370,000 metric tons of propane/butane mix (comprising primarily of propane). This gas is to be sourced from the T engiz field. The commercial arrangements between TCO and KMG PetroChem for gas supply date back to March 2008 when a contract was signed. The GSU would process up to 9.1 Bcm/y and return up to 7.8 Bcm/y of methane to TCO. The extracted ethane and propane/butane mix would feed into a new pyrolysis unit (steam cracker) to produce ethylene that would also be built as part of Phase 2 construction. For the GSU, it is planned to use two licensed installations of Honeywell UOP Inc. (US) technology: one for ethane extraction and another for propane purification. Early in 2021, KMG and Japanese company JGC Holdings Corporation signed an engineering and design contract for the GSU. In March 2023, KMG announced that the GSU would be financed Table 6.12 Kazakhstan’s polyethylene balance (primary forms), 2015–22 (thousand metric tons) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Production 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 2.4 3.4 4.4 Imports 101.3 108.0 125.3 155.5 170.5 182.5 175.4 227.3 Of which, from CIS 73.2 90.5 103.8 136.3 147.5 165.9 157.2 n/a Of"}

In addition to the license, Butadien will have access to the portfolio of life-cycle services of Lummus T echnology during the implementation and operational stages of this project. KazAzot’s ammonia-urea complex in Mangystau Oblast Another of Kazakhstan’s planned petrochemical developments is the construction of a new ammonia and urea (carbamide) complex. In January 2023, KazAzot Prime LLP (a subsidiary of KazAzot JSC that was created in December 2022) signed a contract for the design and construction of the complex with the Spanish engineering company T écnicas Reunidas SA. The new complex is planned to be built in the Aktau Seaport Special Economic Zone (Mangystau Oblast). Estimated capex of the project is $1 billion. The new complex is planned to produce about 1.5 MMt/y in aggregate, including 660,000 t/y of ammonia, 577,500 t/y of urea, 395,000 t/y of weak nitric acid, and 500,000 t/y of ammonium nitrate. The project will use methane (natural gas) as the feedstock, supplied from KazAzot’s own production. Its main field is Shagyrly-Shomyshty, in Mangystau Oblast. The field produced 783 MMcm in 2021 and 800 MMcm in 2022. 78 The company also owns the license to the Kosbulak field, which is still under exploration. So clearly, KazAzot is seeking an alternative monetization route for its natural gas other than selling it as fuel to QazaqGaz. In 2023, the Ministry of Agriculture of Kazakhstan expects domestic demand for urea to be about 703,000 metric tons (versus 604,000 metric tons in 2021), reaching about 900,000 t/y by 2028. Hence, by 2028, when the new complex is expected to reach full capacity, KazAzot is expected to be able to fully cover Kazakhstan’s domestic market demand. Methanol production in West Kazakhstan Oblast In 2022, Zhaik Petroleum Ltd. launched construction of a methanol plant (Phase 1) in West Kazakhstan Oblast. The company signed an EPC contract with CITIC Construction Co. Ltd. and China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. T otal capacity is planned to be 130,000 t/y of methanol, with an estimated capex of $140 million. The commissioning date is reported as 2024. Phase 2 of the project will include production of ammonia and urea, with an estimated capex of $200 million. The expected commissioning date of Phase 2 is 2029. Not to be confused with upstream producer Zhaikmunai LLP, Zhaik Petroleum Ltd LLP does not have its own gas sources, so it remains to be seen if this project can be successfully realized given the shortage of commercial gas.Methanol and olefin production in Atyrau Oblast This proposed project consists of two stages: (1) methanol production from natural gas; (2) production of propylene and ethylene from methanol. This is a rather roundabout process, especially for a country that is long on NGLs and short on methane. Initially, the Kazakhstan Project Preparation Fund LLP (KPPF), Westgasoil PTE LTD (Singapore), and Haldor T opsoe GmbH (Germany) signed a memorandum of understanding for construction of this facility in the SEZ Aktau Seaport Special Economic Zone (Mangystau Oblast) rather than in Atyrau Oblast. Groundbreaking for this facility reportedly began in 2019, with commissioning planned for 2023–24. But now the beginning of construction of the facilities has been postponed to 2027. 79 Polypropylene production in Shymkent city A new planned polypropylene project planned to be built by Almex Polymer LLP has a capacity of 80,000 t/y, with an expected commissioning date of 2025. The project is considered to be phase 2 of the Shymkent Chemical Company 80 MTBE project commissioned in 2021. The plant will be located in the Ontustik special economic zone in Shymkent city. Feedstock is planned to be Shymkent refinery fluxes. T otal expected cost of the project is $89.2 million. Terephthalic acid and polyethylene terephthalate in Atyrau Oblast The expected capacity of this project will be 600,000 t/y of terephthalic acid and 430,000 t/y of polyethylene terephthalate. The main feedstock will be benzene and paraxylene from the Atyrau refinery. This project is being developed by Almex Petrochemical LLP. T otal estimated cost of the project is $1 billion. Earlier, in 2017, it was announced that some project financing would be forthcoming from the Development Bank of Kazakhstan (DBK), but the project no longer appears on the list of projects applying for DBK funding in 2022. The feasibility study for the project has been completed; construction of the plant is expected to begin in 2023–24, with commissioning in 2026. 6.10.3 Export issues and logistics for petrochemicals in western Kazakhstan As a landlocked country in the center of the Eurasian continent, one of the key factors to consider for an export-oriented petrochemical plant in Kazakhstan is the logistics, including costs and routes to market. Shipment of containerized polymer pellets, often in bags, is one of the most cost-effective methods of exporting petrochemicals from landlocked and remote areas. 79 In March 2022, Qazaqstan Investment Corporation JSC (formerly Kazyna Capital Management) announced a company reorganization of this project, joining with KPPF and another company, QazT ech Ventures JSC."}

This route involves using the Volga-Don Canal to connect between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. This route is limited by size of ship (because of draft and width restrictions for ships of about 5,000 deadweight tons [dwt]), and seasonally, as this route is closed during the winter. Access to markets such as India and Southeast Asia could be served by a southerly overland rail route through Turkmenistan and Iran to Bandar Abbas on the Persian Gulf. New rail infrastructure is being developed for this route; however, it is not a route used by large volumes of freight traffic. Despite these sizable transportation costs, KMG and other petrochemical producers could very well compete in these key markets, especially in polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene. However, this appears more uncertain for methanol, as it is a lower-value primary petrochemical shipped in liquid form. A key factor in determining the economics of these projects is prices for these petrochemical products in the destination markets. Given the current national balances for polypropylene and polyethylene, only some of the output from the new plants can be absorbed domestically; most of their output will have to be exported, rather than consumed domestically. 6.11 Natural Gas Trade: Historical and Outlook 6.11.1 Kazakhstan’s gas exports Kazakhstan’s statistics on natural gas trade come from several official sources that nonetheless conflict with each other, given different methodologies. According to the Ministry of Energy, in 2022, Kazakhstan’s exported 4.6 Bcm of natural gas, 36% lower than in 2021. 81 At the same time, Kazakhstan’s Statistical Agency reported gas exports at 6.7 Bcm. S&P Global estimates operational (physical flows) gas exports were 13 Bcm in 2022, where 5.1 Bcm was exported to China and 7.9 Bcm went to Russia (see Table 6.4 and Table 6.13 Kazakhstan’s natural gas exports and imports by destination 2015-22). The difference in reporting in large part stems from what is included in the exports, with the main reason being the varying treatment of gas volumes sent to Russia. Mostly this gas is via the KPO-KRG 82 swap arrangement, where KPO gas is sent to Orenburg GPZ and then processed gas is mostly returned to Kazakhstan for domestic consumption. 83 In this respect, Kazakhstan’s imports of KRG gas under the swap volumes, and by extension, KPO’s commercial gas output, are integral to Kazakhstan’s overall gas balance. 84 So, the Ministry of Energy and QazaqGaz several years ago began excluding the volumes of swap gas from the export figures and only report gas exports to China, whereas the Statistical Agency accounts for some of the gas that physically went to Russia. 85 In addition to KPO, small volumes of Kazakh gas (from TCO) historically have been transported northward to Russia via the CAC and Soyuz pipelines. In the past, TCO gas exports ranged around 2-3 Bcm; they amounted to 3.7 Bcm in 2019, 2.5 Bcm in 2020, and 1 Bcm in 2021. 86 However, given the growing tightness if the overall gas balance, QazaqGaz reached an agreement with TCO whereby most of its gas is now diverted to the domestic market (~2 Bcm in 2022). Reported TCO exports in 2022 were only 0.2 Bcm. The agreement to sell gas to QazaqGaz is to continue for 2023 as well. Exports to China plummeted in 2022 by 21%, according to S&P Global estimates. Several factors created a perfect storm for this decline, especially during the winter of 2022-23. Lower domestic gas production, lower imports, a 2.4 Bcm reduction in gas output at the Orenburg GPZ due to decreased ability of that plant to accept gas, breakdowns at the Kashagan and T engiz gas processing plants, as well as higher gas consumption (helped by extremely low temperatures) squeezed exports, which forced Kazakhstan to cut exports to China for three months, even though gas exports are extremely important for QazaqGaz’s financial stability. 87 Kazakhstan exported less gas to China in every month in 2022 than in 2021, except in August and September. China Customs data shows that Kazakh gas imports were significantly reduced between November 2022 and March 2023, with an estimated import volume of less than 0.5 Bcm during those five months, representing an 80% year-over-year decrease for the period. The onset of curtailed gas exports in November 2022 prompted China’s Premier Li Keqiang to appeal to the Kazakh Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov to adhere to gas supply contracts and increase deliveries during the winter months. 82 KazRosGas (KRG) is a joint venture between KMG and Russia’s Gazprom formed in 2007. In June 2015, KPO and KRG extended their gas trading deal through 2038, securing an outlet for KPO’s gas production through the end of the PSA. 83 Gas exports from Karachaganak to Russia are conducted under a special arrangement with Gazprom. Nearly all of Karachaganak’s raw (high-sulfur) gas output (that is not reinjected) is sent across the border to Russia for processing at the Orenburg GPZ under a long-term agreement, with KRG playing a key intermediary role. 84 In 2022, KRG exported 0.37 Bcm of gas compared to 1.5 Bcm in 2021. 85 Kazakhstan’s customs statistics indicate a broader list of export destinations for Kazakh gas, including small volumes to Ukraine and Turkey in 2022. These data reflect"}

Gas balance tightness in Kazakhstan has been developing over many years, but it can be remedied with policy changes. During 2022, there were a lot of discussions about “imminent” gas shortages in the country. Kazakhstan’s energy minister announced on 8 June 2022 that the country would halt gas exports by 2025 to focus on the domestic market, even as oil production curbs also reduced associated gas production. In February 2023, QazaqGaz announced that gas exports to China will likely be halted during the 2023-24 heating season, to avoid shortages in the domestic market. Nonetheless, during the “China–Central Asia Summit” in Xian (People’s Republic of China) on 18–19 May 2023, as part of the cooperation agreement, QazaqGaz and CNPC pledged to sign a new natural gas purchase and sales agreement. In July 2023, QazaqGaz reported that it is negotiating a new gas export contract with China. During the first half of 2023, Kazakhstan exported around 1.8 Bcm of gas, which is 26% less than during January-June of 2022. In 2023, QazaqGaz secured higher gas imports and will likely see higher output numbers, but the challenge of managing the national gas balance remain. Clearly any kind of unanticipated event, like a spate of extreme cold weather, could endanger exports in the winter months. Longer-term, Kazakhstan will likely continue to send (relatively small) volumes of gas to China, possibly with seasonal wintertime reductions or even interruptions. Our base-case scenario is that domestic gas market reforms (price increases and improved E&P terms) and policy changes (construction of GPZs and additional imports) will likely result in rebalancing of the gas balance and a rebound in Kazakhstan’s gas exports in the late 2020s. In the base case, Kazakhstan’s exports to China decline from 5.1 Bcm in 2022 to 3.2 Bcm in 2025 but expand to 3.9 Bcm in 2030 and 7.6 Bcm in 2040. Russia remains a major “export” destination (for processing Karachaganak gas) over the output period as well. S&P Global’s base case projects Kazakhstan’s overall operational exports by 2050 to decline by 48% relative to the 2022 level, to about 6.7 Bcm (see Figure 6.23 Kazakhstan’s natural gas exports and imports by destination: S&P Global base-case outlook to 2050). 182 Figure 6.23 Kazakhstan’s natural gas exports and imports by destination: S&P Global base-case outlook to 2050 (Bcm) Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global. 6.11.2 Kazakhstan’s gas imports Imports remain an important component of the domestic gas balance. In 2022 QazaqGaz reported gas imports of 1.34 Bcm in 2022. S&P Global estimates gas imports (based on physical flows) at 7.4 Bcm in 2022, with 7 Bcm coming from Russia and the remainder from Turkmenistan (see Table 6.4 and Table 6.13). QazaqGaz reported that in 2022 the Orenburg GPZ was not able to provide expected volumes of processed gas back to the domestic market due to technical limitations at the plant. 88 This also fed in to the overall supply crunch in Kazakhstan. For 2023, QazaqGaz sought additional supply guarantees from Russia for other sources of gas should Orenburg GPZ face processing challenges again. Kazakhstan’s imports of Turkmen gas are playing an increasingly important role in ensuring energy security in southern Kazakhstan, especially with the loss of Uzbek imports. In October 2022, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart T okayev announced that JSC NC QazaqGaz (QazaqGaz) and Turkmengaz had signed a short-term contract for Turkmen gas imports (0.4 Bcm in 2022) and that Kazakhstan is ready to conclude a long-term agreement for 1.5 Bcm/y. In early 2022, QazaqGaz even announced its ambitions to participate as an upstream partner in upstream development in Turkmenistan, at Galkynysh Phase 3, to increase the company’s commercial gas resource base. In the future, S&P Global expects that Kazakhstan will continue to rely on gas"}

T otal Kazakh gas imports are projected to be around 5.6 Bcm in 2030 and increase further to about 11.6 Bcm in 2050 (see Table 6.13). Imports are an effective way to serve border regions in the south and north of the country and provide Kazakhstan greater flexibility in its gas balance. Russian gas is used primarily in Kostanay and Aktobe oblasts, while previously Uzbek and now Turkmen imported gas is used in southern Kazakhstan (Almaty, Taraz, and Shymkent cities and Turkestan oblast). 89 In our base-case outlook, Turkmen gas exports to Kazakhstan will rise, reaching about 2 Bcm/y by 2030 and 6.3 Bcm in 2050. Russian gas imports continue between 4-5 Bcm to 2050. While Kazakhstan is expected to remain a net gas exporter through 2040, thanks in large part to KPO deliveries to the Orenburg GPZ, the country will switch to being a net gas importer by about 2045 (see Figure 6.23). 88 Currently, Orenburg GPZ is facing technical issues related to the acceptance of additional volumes of high-sulfur Karachaganak gas. The situation is exacerbated further due to the Western sanctions on Russia that preclude imports of specialized equipment and parts.89 The reach of Russian gas imported from the north extends further south, to Mangystau and even Kyzylorda oblasts. The reach of the gas is set to expand further, depending on the gasification decision for northern and eastern Kazakhstan. 183 6.12 Kazakhstan's Official Gas Balance Outlook to 2030 6.12.1 Official gas production outlook Kazakhstan’s Comprehensive Plan for the Development of the Gas Industry for 2022-2026 (hereafter, the Plan, or Gas Development Plan) provides an official gas balance to 2030. The plan was released in November 2022, so some of the data (2022 estimates) are already dated. The forecast to 2030 envisions gross gas output of 87.089 Bcm, with sales gas output of 42.218 Bcm. In the interim period, the forecast shows an increase in gross gas production in 2024 (by 7.9 Bcm) driven by higher output from the existing fields category and then a significant output increase by 2027 (by 9.7 Bcm), also largely driven by production at the existing fields (see Figure 6.24 Kazakhstan's official raw gas production outlook to 2030). Likely, the 2024 increase corresponds with the expected completion of the Future Growth Project at T engiz, although that is expected to come towards the end of 2024, and so higher output should only be visible in 2025. The increase in 2027 is likely related to the anticipated start-up of Kashagan phase 2A. The official gas production outlook also specifies expected gas production volumes from new fields; this volume ramps up to almost 5.5 Bcm by 2030 (see Figure 6.4). About half of production is expected to come from Central Urikhtau (post-2024), West Prorva, Anabay (2023), and Pridorozhnoye (2027). The Plan provides a production forecast for these four fields, with output rising to 2.2 Bcm in 2030. The plan states that additional gas output could come from the T eplovsko-T okarevskaya group of fields, the Ansagan (Almeks+) and Rozhkovskoye (2023) fields, as well as from Kalamkas-More. 90 According to the Plan, the share of reinjected gas is set to increase from 32% in 2021 to 50% in 2029. 91 The Plan acknowledges that gas reinjection has been an effective way of maintaining reservoir pressure at the T engiz and Karachaganak fields, and that lower reinjection will lead to lower liquids output from these projects. Still, the Plan keeps the possibility of utilizing additional gas from these fields open, stating that “at the T engiz and Karachaganak fields, taking into account the agreed expansion projects, the choice in favor of gas commercialization will be carefully studied and justified with an individual approach in terms of technological and economic parameters and agreed with the authorized state bodies and partners.” Although the potential construction of a 4 Bcm/y gas processing plant at Karachaganak does not seem to be included in the Plan from 2022, a 2023 draft of the Comprehensive Plan for the Development of the Largest Oil and Gas and Petrochemical projects for 2023-2027 includes such a possibility, reportedly without a significant impact on liquids production through 2037 (the end of KPO’s Final Production Sharing Agreement). The GPZ could be put into operation by 2030, although under an accelerated schedule the plant could start up by 2028, according to KPO. S&P Global considers this an ambitious timetable and projects the GPZ start-up in 2035. As for the Kashagan project, where phase 2A and 2B expansion projects are already under active discussion, construction of additional gas processing capacity is seen as a high priority in the Plan. In addition to a new 1 Bcm/y gas processing plant by QazaqGaz using Kashagan gas, negotiations are ongoing for adding even more gas processing capacity. Indeed, a 2023 draft of the Comprehensive Plan for the Development of the Largest Oil and Gas and Petrochemical Projects for 2023-2027 provides additional details on another Kashagan GPZ. The Ministry of Energy is negotiating with NCOC shareholders on the construction of a gas processing plant with a capacity of 4 Bcm/y as part of the implementation of stage 2A of development. Other investors are also actively being courted as well, with announcements that CNPC and Abu Dhabi investors are evaluating the project. The main goal of the Gas Development Plan is increasing the production of commercial gas to 42.1 Bcm/y by 2030, to ensure sufficient supply to the domestic market, 92 to maintain the potential for gas exports to China, and to provide feedstock to support petrochemical development. This assumes an average annual sales gas production growth of 4% per year in 2022-30. The balance also assumes that losses and shrinkage decline from about 7.4 Bcm in 2022 to 3.8 Bcm by 2030. Additionally, own use is estimated at 8.7 Bcm in 2030 or 10% of gross output (see Figure 6.25 Gas production outlook according to Kazakhstan's official gas development plan). 6.12.2"}

Specifically, for existing consumers (comprising the largest share of the total), consumption is expected to grow at an average rate of 2.5% per year, from 18.3 Bcm in 2022 to 22.8 Bcm in 2030. We presume that gasification, even though it is being extended to new households, is still included in this “existing” consumer category. Meanwhile, the new consumer category, which is disaggregated into the power sector, petrochemicals, and gas switching by large industrial producers, grows at an average annual rate of 22.4% during the same time period, albeit from a low base. In absolute terms, the new consumption category grows from 1.5 Bcm in 2022 to 9.6 Bcm in 2030, with the power sector accounting for 72% (6.9 Bcm) of this “new” consumption in 2030. Petrochemicals account for 21% of this category at 2 Bcm, with gas switching by industrial users accounting for the rest (0.7 Bcm). According to the official forecast, this means that Kazakhstan will be short of gas for exports, starting in 2025. 90 The Plan also calls for additional exploration at the Imashevskoye field (172 Bcm), which is a 50-50 shared field between Kazakhstan and Russia. 91 In the Ministry forecast, reinjected gas volumes more than double by 2030 from the current level in absolute terms.92 Domestic gas supply includes: (1) ensuring stable gas supply to the southern and central regions where gasification is expanding (including to new commercial consumers such as Almaty TETs-2, ERG, and ArcelorMittal JSC); and (2) supporting the planned switching of heat-and-power stations to gas. 184 Figure 6.24 Kazakhstan’s official raw gas production outlook to 2030 (Bcm) Source: Kazakhstan’s Comprehensive Plan for the Development of the Gas Industry for 2022-2026, S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global.

This significant change from just a few years ago is likely explained by a recognition that available feedstock (methane) is lacking in the medium term. The demand by “new” power sector generation was also revised, but upwards from 5.7 Bcm by 2030 in the 2021 forecast to 6.9 Bcm by 2030 in the 2022 forecast. This forecast seems overly ambitious. The list of the planned additions in the power sector is broadly known, and S&P Global expects that many of these additions that will occur after 2030. There are three projects, however, clearly given a priority (included in Decree 730 on “Sustainable Economic Growth Aimed at Improving the Well-being of Kazakhstan’s Nationals,” from 12 October, 2021). 93 Those are the 1 GW combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) project in Turkestan, 450 MW TETs-2 in Almaty, and 250 MW CCGT in Kyzylorda. The current list of additional gas-fired capacity (including the aforementioned three) is as follows: ►Turkestan Oblast CCGT (up to 1 GW). In July 2022, Turkestan CCGT LLP (50% owned by NWF Samruk-Kazyna) won a tender for the construction of a gas-fired power plant to increase flexible capacity in the national power grid. 94 With a capacity of up to 1000 MW and a tariff of 16,275,800 tenge/MW/month (ex-VAT), the plant’s commissioning date was supposed to be in 2026, but the schedule has already slipped to 2027. In March 2023, a consortium of Korean Doosan Enerbility and Kazakh Bazis Construction won a tender for turnkey construction of the plant at an estimated cost of 700 billion tenge ($1.5 billion). Investors are expected to recoup their investments in 15 years. In June 2023, mobilization of the construction equipment reportedly began, with actual construction beginning in July 2023. The plant is expected to consume about 1.15 Bcm/y, supplied via the BBS or BGR-TBA pipelines. ►Almaty TETs-2 conversion to gas (510 MW). In May 2023, a consortium from China won the tender to convert the heat-and-power plant to gas, in order to reduce air pollution level in Almaty city. 95 The consortium includes Dongfang Electric International Corporation, Powerchina Sepco 1 Electric Power Construction Co. Ltd, and Powerchina Hebei Electric Power Engineering Co. Ltd. The total cost of the project is estimated at 435.8 billion tenge ($968 billion), financed with a 117 billion tenge ($260 million) loan from the Development Bank of Kazakhstan (DBK), 87.16 billion tenge coming from the plant’s owner Almaty Electric Stations (AlES), and the rest provided by loans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Development Bank, and the Development Bank of Kazakhstan. Following modernization and conversion to gas, the plant’s capacity will increase from 510 MW to 600 MW; the plant will also produce heat (957 Gcal/h capacity). The expected commissioning date is set for December 2026. Construction was supposed to start during the summer of 2023. Gas consumption is projected at 0.8 Bcm/y.►CCGT in Kyzylorda city (250 MW). In July 2022, Turkey’s Aksa Enerji Üretim A.Ş. won an auction for the construction of a CCGT (with at least 240 MW capacity) with flexible generation capacity in Kyzylorda Oblast. 96 The plant’s estimated cost is 215 billion tenge ($477 million) with 2025 as the initial start-up date, although this also appears to have slipped to at least 2026. In accordance with a long-term (15 years) agreement with the Settlement and Financial Center for the Support of Renewable Energy Sources LLP, Aksa Enerji Üretim will receive a guaranteed return on investment through its tariff scheme. Construction reportedly started in 2022 with Aksa Enerji reporting in February 2023 of a contract with GE for"}

The plant is expected to consume about 0.3 Bcm/y. Other projects planned include ►CCGT in Zhezkazgan city. With a capacity of 100 MW, this project planned to launch in 2026. In August 2023, contracts for the CCGT’s construction and for preparation of design documentation were signed with China’s Sinohydro Co. Ltd. and Sepco Electric Power Construction Co. The estimated cost of the project is 80 billion tenge ($178 million). ►Power plant JSC “TNK Kazchrome.” This plant, of up to100 MW (ERG) in Aktobe Oblast, is planned to launch in 2026. ►CCGT Shymkent. This plant, with a capacity of 450 MW, is being developed by ERG. It is currently planned for launch 2027. The project is under environmental review. ►Almaty TETs-3 conversion to gas (450 MW). This project is currently planned for completion in 2026. The timeline seems somewhat ambitions, given that the project is currently only in the planning stages. The estimated cost of the project is 324 billion tenge ($720 million). ►Almaty TETs-1 conversion to gas (250 MW). This project also is currently planned for completion in 2026, but is more likely to materialize post-2030. The estimated cost of the project is 107 billion tenge ($238 million). ►TETs-5 conversion to gas. This project, located in Kentay city, Turkestan Oblast has a capacity of 36 MW. ►TETs-3 in Semey city. This plant, with a capacity of 360 MW, is planned to have the capability to run on both coal and natural gas. Currently a feasibility study is being developed. It is planned to be commissioned in 2026, running initially entirely on coal. Overall, the current outlook clearly envisions greatly increased gas use in the power sector. The question is more about the timing of construction of the new power plants. In S&P Global’s view, the three power plants that are in more advanced stages of construction will come online before 2030, while construction of some of the other gas power plants is likely to be more protracted, not only because of the difficulties involving in executing the actual construction, but also due to delays in the availability of gas supply for the plants. 93 https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P2100000730. 94 On 22 September 2022, Samruk-Kazyna transferred the Turkestan CCGT project to its subsidiary Samruk-Kazyna Construction JSC in 100% trust management. 95 Almaty TETs-2 is an important heat and power plant in the region, providing about 70% of heat in the Almaty district heating zone and 50% of Almaty’s electricity. 96 During the auction the price range from the bidders was reported from 11,612,100 to 11,591,000 tenge per MW per month without VAT. 186 6.13 Gas Pricing in Kazakhstan State regulation of the wholesale price of commercial gas is carried out by the Ministry of Energy and the retail price by the Ministry of National Economy (via KREM, its monopoly regulation agency). The regulation of retail prices affects the entire value chain in the industry. In additional to the changes in producer prices implemented for “new” gas described above, there were several important changes in the wholesale and end-user prices in 2022, including the introduction of new end-consumer categories. 6.13.1 Retail prices Kazakhstan’s State Committee for Regulating Natural Monopolies (KREM) regulates end-user gas prices by region and customer type (residential versus industrial). Its approach is guided not strictly by energy policy per se, but broader macroeconomic considerations, with government inflation targets being perhaps one of the major factors guiding KREM’s gas pricing approach. At its core, KREM’s pricing mechanism is essentially “cost-plus,” with end-user prices reflecting wide differences in gas delivery costs in different parts of Kazakhstan. 97On 31 August 2023, KREM’s Head of the Department for Regulation of Oil and Gas Transportation, Ruslan Gasanov, in an interview essentially confirmed that the retail price is composed of three components: a wholesale price, a ceiling tariff for gas transportation through distribution networks, and the costs associated with the sale of commercial gas. 98 In 2022 a change took place in Kazakhstan’s end-user pricing policy, with the introduction of four new consumer categories – large commercial consumers, 99 crypto miners, entities purchasing natural gas for the production of LNG or CNG, and socially vulnerable groups (receiving support from the government) (see Table 6.14 Current categories of retail level gas consumers for KTG Aimak). 100 The first two consumer groups (large commercial consumers, crypto miners) are expected to pay higher prices to fully cover higher costs of production and imports of “new” gas. Gas for LNG and CNG is also priced relatively higher. The socially protected segment receives a significantly lower price. Until 2022, there were only six categories of end-users. According to retail gas prices published by KTG-Aimak, beginning from 1 August 2023 the average price for residential consumers is 17,422 tenge/Mcm; this is 8% higher compared to residential prices introduced on 1 January 2023. For large commercial Figure 6.26 Kazakhstan’s official gas consumption outlook (Bcm) Source: Kazakhstan’s Comprehensive Plan for the Development of the Gas Industry for 2022-2026, S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global. 97 Kazakhstan’s Law on Natural Monopolies and supporting rules issued by KREM establish a methodology to calculate an acceptable profit rate for gas transportation companies (QazaqGaz and subsidiaries) based on their regulated asset base, which reflects their expenditures and investment programs. In practice, determination of end-user prices still follows a “cost-plus” approach where an acceptable profit rate is believed to be no more than 10%.98 https://forbes.kz/news/2023/08/31/newsid_308124?ysclid=llzdibpn2p222455809; Gasanov did not mention an investment component within the price formula. According to him, at present, the average retail gas price in Kazakhstan is 24.2 tenge per cubic meter and is composed of a wholesale price (18.9 tenge per m 3), plus transportation component (4.3 tenge per m3), plus costs of sale (0.9 tenge per m3). These prices exclude VAT. 99 Large commercial consumers are legal entities that consume 10 MMcm/y or more. 100 The Group VII consumer category does not appear in the official price tables. 187 customers and digital miners (new"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_NationalReport23_en_128", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\NationalReport23_en.pdf", "text": "consumer categories) the average price is set at 35,540 tenge/Mcm, more than double the residential rate. For households receiving state support, the price is set at 13,593 tenge/Mcm, about 22% lower than the regular residential price. 101 Retail prices vary widely by region— for example, a crypto miner in Almaty would pay 54,328 tenge/Mcm, while in Astana it would pay 44,552 tenge/Mcm and in West Kazakhstan about 18,766 tenge/Mcm. Prices vary because of the source of gas (domestic versus imports) and the amount of domestic transportation involved. T o curb excessive gas consumption in periods of high gas demand, due, for example, to severe weather, the government of Kazakhstan passed in April 2023 new amendments to the Rules for the retail sale and use of commercial and liquefied petroleum gas, where consumers, including large commercial consumers and crypto miners, that have back-up fuel capabilities can have gas deliveries (consumption) curtailed, especially during the fall-winter heating season. If they withdraw over 5% more gas than allowed in their contracts, gas supply to these consumers can be restricted back to the average daily norm three hours after the consumer is notified about it. Also, if excessive consumption occurs without prior coordination with the gas supplier, these consumers will face payment penalties ranging from 20 to 50% of the price of the gas delivered in excess of the volumes established in the contract, depending on the time of year. 102 The legislation also requires that separate records are kept for the use of commercial gas and electricity for digital mining activities. 104 See Order of the Minister of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 209 of 15 December 2014 “On Approval of the Rules for Determining the Ceiling Prices for the Wholesale Commercial Gas Sales in the Domestic Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Ceiling Prices for the Liquefied Petroleum Gas Sold within the Framework of the Plan for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Supply to the Domestic Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan outside Electronic Sales Platforms,” as amended on 30 March 2020. https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/V1400010120. Currently, the government is looking into a possibility of introducing differentiated end user gas tariffs to encourage more careful use of natural gas. In March 2023, President T okayev encouraged the government to consider differentiated tariff approach that is widely used in practice abroad. 6.13.2 Wholesale prices The Ministry of Energy in coordination with the Ministry of National Economy sets ceiling wholesale prices. At the end of 2022, the government approved amendments to the Law on Gas and Gas Supply, whereby wholesale ceiling prices for natural gas are now set for a five-year period to provide longer-term views for gas market players (previously ceiling prices were set annually). Annual price corrections are allowed, however, with price adjustments taking place on 1 July. 103 Wholesale ceiling prices are set by oblast, and separately for the cities of republican significance, and the capital, as well as for entities who use natural gas to produce CNG or LNG for further sale to end-consumers. Wholesale price ceilings are calculated as weighted average purchase prices in that region, including transportation, but are also supposed to reflect economic and social conditions of regional gas supply. Although there were active discussions over the past few years on lifting the 15% per year limit on changes in ceiling wholesale price, this official rule still stands in 2023. 104Table 6.14 Current categories of retail level gas consumers for KTG Aimak Source: KTG Aimak, S&P Global. © 2023 S&P Global.1 Group IHousehold consumers (population) receiving services for the retail sale of commercial gas from the gas distribution system 2 Group II Heat and power companies that purchase commercial gas in order to generate heat for the population 3 Group IIIThermal power companies purchasing commercial gas in order to generate thermal energy for legal entities 4 Group IV Heat and power companies that purchase commercial gas for the production of electricity 5 Group V Other consumers not included in I, II, III, IV, VI, VII, VIII and IX consumer groups 6 Group VI Budgetary organizations maintained at the expense of budgetary funds 7 Group VIIILegal entities purchasing commercial gas for the production of compressed and (or) liquefied natural gas for the purpose of further sale to consumers 8 Group IX Household consumers (population) receiving state targeted social assistance and (or) housing assistance 9 Group X Large commercial customers 10 Group XI Persons carrying out digital mining or persons producing electrical energy for digital mining 101 These prices do not include the transportation tariff through the gas distribution system. If the latter is included, then the average residential price is set at 22,234 tenge/Mcm, the price for large commercial consumers and crypto miners is set at 39,811 tenge/Mcm, and the protected group’s price is set at 17,379 tenge/Mcm. 102 https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/V1400009936. 103 Adjustments are made no more than once a year on the basis of the national operator’s application to the authorized body in connection with a change in the purchase prices of commercial gas, the structure and (or) sources of commercial gas, and (or) tariffs subject to state regulation for the transportation of commercial gas through main gas pipelines and storage of commercial gas in underground gas facilities. 188 105 In the past, gas prices for the new power plants were set for ten years at $60/Mcm. https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/V2300032937.Another change adopted in December 2022 concerned consumers that are considered “new” gas-fired power projects, where the length of time for which ceiling wholesale prices are set was reduced from ten to five years. These prices are set separately for each consumer and for new power plants included in the strategic list of power plants prices are now based on the weighted cost of gas +7% and, if necessary, can be adjusted annually on 1 July. 105 The Order of the Minister of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 246 dated 30 June 2023 approved ceiling wholesale prices in Kazakhstan’s domestic market for the commercial gas intended for subsequent sale to"}

Historically these tariffs tended to rise only slowly and sometimes were revised downward. With the construction of the Saryarka pipeline and the need to pay for its loans, however, the domestic tariff increased substantially, from 2,333.3 tenge/Mcm ($5.7/Mcm) in 2020 to 4,551 tenge/Mcm ($10.65/Mcm) in 2021. For the period 2022-26, the tariff for domestic gas deliveries via the ICA system is set at 5,286 tenge/Mcm ($11.75/Mcm) (see Table 6.16 S&P Global’s outlook for trunk and distribution gas pipeline transportation tariffs in Kazakhstan, 2018-26). 106 In August 2023, ICA already requested a 2.6% tariff increase to 5,426 tenge/Mcm to reflect rising wages at the company. 107 Besides operational costs, QazaqGaz contends that the current ICA tariff does not stimulate investment in the gas transportation system. A similar contention applies to distribution tariffs. In 2022, for example, the simple unweighted average KTG-Aimak distribution tariff decreased by 12% year on year to 4,490 tenge/ Mcm ($9.98/Mcm) despite all of the expenditure and effort going into expanding the distribution system to support gasification. Tariffs for domestic shipments on most trunk pipelines are set by the regulator as postage stamp–type tariffs (tenge/Mcm) that do not reflect distance. However, this probably will change in the future, as the gas sector moves toward a market-based (or at least cost-reflective) future, where tariffs reflect the distance gas travels. Such an approach already has been applied to the BBS pipeline tariff, where from 1 January 2021 the tariff was set in tenge per Mcm per 100 km. For 2022 the BBS tariff was set at 1,158.41 tenge/Mcm/100 km ($2.51/Mcm/100 km, without VAT) or 15,557 tenge/Mcm ($34.57/Mcm, without VAT), applicable to both exports and domestic deliveries. 108 The distance-based BBS tariff lowers the cost of gas delivered to Astana via the Saryarka pipeline, because the gas travels only 944 km on the BBS (64% of the distance) to the Karaozek compressor station, rather than the pipeline’s entire 1,477 km length to Shymkent. KREM, through its regional offices, sets distribution tariffs for a five-year period, but tariffs are often adjusted more frequently, sometimes biannually, to reflect ongoing investments in expanding local distribution infrastructure. 109 Unlike tariffs for domestic deliveries, gas transportation tariffs for international transit via ICA and other QazaqGaz-operated pipelines are established through bilateral negotiations and are not subject to regulation by KREM. ICA and Gazprom negotiate the tariff for the transit of Uzbek and Turkmen gas to Russia, which is currently set at $2.42/Mcm/100 km. The tariff for shipments to China via CAGP (or Asia Gas Pipeline"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_NationalReport23_en_130", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\NationalReport23_en.pdf", "text": "[AGP] on Kazakh territory) is $3.58/Mcm/100 km. The CAGP tariff has not been altered in recent years and will likely remain relatively stable over the near term. The transit fee for exporting gas by TCO (or the few other Kazakh producers with the right to export) also are negotiated with ICA. For TCO, it is $5/Mcm/100 km, while KRG’s transit tariff is $2.42/Mcm/100 km. In the medium term to 2026, transportation tariffs are largely set and we do not expect dramatic changes in most domestic gas transportation tariffs through the mid-2020s; they will likely move in tandem with inflation and reflect mainly maintenance expenditures over the near term. However, construction of the second string of the BBS pipeline, and later on the gasification network in the north of the country, will necessitate a substantial increase in tariffs. Additionally, QazaqGaz is focused on substantial upgrades of its dilapidated pipeline infrastructure, even though the company argues that the current approach to transportation tariffs fails to stimulate investment in the gas transportation system. 106 The 2022-26 ICA tariff was converted to dollars using an exchange rate of 450 tenge per dollar. 107 Recent amendments to the legislation regulating natural monopolies includes a provision where an increase in monthly regional wages, calculated by official statistics, may serve as grounds for tariff revisions before the established deadlines.108 The rate of 15,557 tenge/Mcm is apparently calculated based on the distance along the Bozoy-Shymkent segment only, and does not include the Beyneu-Bozoy segment.

S&P Global expects that price harmonization will likely materialize during 2025-30 or possibly slightly later once various details of the common market framework are finalized. During this process, end-user gas prices in Kazakhstan would need to rise substantially, as Russian prices are much higher than those in Kazakhstan. Russian domestic gas prices are differentiated by consumer group and price zones, depending on transportation distances from the main producing region in West Siberia to consumers. Kazakhstan’s policymakers would need to decide with which Russian pricing zone(s) to harmonize, especially in its main production centers in western Kazakhstan. 110 In S&P Global’s assessment, Kazakhstan should harmonize its natural gas prices with those in Russia’s gas-producing regions (e.g., Yamal-Nenets Okrug) and not with the higher prices in European Russia’s consuming regions, such as neighboring Saratov Oblast (see Figure 6.27 Price outlook for natural gas consumed in industry in western Kazakhstan (Atyrau Oblast): Harmonized with Russia’s Yamal-Nenets Okrug). Such an approach would: ►allow Kazakhstan’s manufacturing industry to remain competitive within the broader EAEU economic space ►enable the government to raise consumer prices more gradually (although still significantly) ►help QazaqGaz achieve cost-recovery in the domestic segment of its operations ►potentially incentivize new commercial gas production. Under an EAEU integration scenario, industrial gas prices in Kazakhstan would need to appreciate by about 19.9% annually during 2025–30 to reach parity with those in Russia’s gas-producing regions. Of course, one of the key unknowns in this forecast is the ruble exchange rate and its relation with the tenge. The tenge historically has been affected by ruble moves, and this dynamic is expected to continue into the future. If the ruble depreciates even more significantly than in the recent past, the gap Kazakh domestic gas prices would need to close could become smaller. An additional emerging challenge is that domestic prices within Russia are now expected to increase more substantially than prior to the Ukraine conflict because of the need to generate more state budget revenue given reduced export volumes. 110 In Russia, as in Kazakhstan, prices for industrial consumers located in gas- producing regions are much lower than prices for enterprises in more distant, non-producing regions, mainly because of the transportation component. 192 Figure 6.27 Price outlook for natural gas consumed in industry in western Kazakhstan (Atyrau Oblast): Harmonized with Russia’s Yamal-Nenets Okrug ($/Mcm) Notes: *Prices include VAT.

However, in contrast to methane supplies, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) (and ethane) feedstocks in the country are relatively abundant. 111 Kazakhstan is a sizable producer and exporter of LPGs, producing around 3.2 MMt annually over the period 2019–21, although output fell by 12.5% to 2.8 MMt in 2022 as a result of lower associated gas output at the “Big 3” projects as well as the generally depressed demand environment in certain export markets (Ukraine) following the outbreak of armed conflict there (see Figure 6.28 LPG production in Kazakhstan by producer). Most of Kazakhstan’s LPG production (73%) comes from processing of associated gas at GPZs, with oil refining contributing the remainder. TCO is the largest individual producer by far, accounting for 43% of total output in 2022 (or 1.2 MMt of the 2.8 MMt total). Other important gas-processing LPG producers include: the Zhanazhol GPZ owned by CNPC-AktobeMunayGaz (511.3 Mt in 2022; 18% of total output) and KazGPZ at KMG’s Uzen field (181.6 Mt; 6.4%) (see Figure 6.28). The share of LPGs produced at the country’s three main oil refineries—Atyrau, Pavlodar, and Shymkent—increased dramatically following the completion of Kazakhstan’s refinery modernization program in 2018 to deepen their refining operations, rising from 14% in 2017 to 27% in 2022. Despite sizable LPG output and exports in Kazakhstan, news of domestic LPG shortages are widely reported, especially during the past year. 112 The Ministry of Energy sets quotas for LPG supplies from producers to the domestic market at regulated prices. Some LPG producers, such as those operating under Production Sharing Agreements (PSA) or other arrangements, most notably TCO and ZhaikMunay, do not receive domestic delivery quotas, as they have the contractual right to export 100% of their output. Thus, the effective amount of LPGs available for the domestic market, without TCO/ZhaikMunay volumes, is significantly less. In 2022, available volumes were only around 1.6 MMt vs. estimated LPG demand of 1.8 MMt. The Ministry reports that with current LPG production (not subject to PSAs), it can cover only 90% of LPG demand in the country and that the situation gets significantly worse during maintenance periods. In 2023, TCO sold some of its LPG volumes on the domestic market (but at commercial rather than regulated prices) to help cover the deficit. In August 2023, the Ministry proposed a draft order to ban for three years all exports of LPGs by road and for six months exports by rail. This would be a continuation and tightening of the existing LPG export ban that covers only road exports. 113 111 See The National Energy Report 2021, p. 132.112 Most recently in August 2023, an accident at the Mangystau Nuclear Power Engineering Plant (MAEK) resulted in LPG shortages in Mangystau Oblast because the lack of electricity led to a shutdown at the Atyrau refinery. 113 In 2020, the Minister of Energy issued a 3-year ban on LPG exports by road, according to an Order dated 7 October 2020 No. 347. 193 Figure 6.28 LPG production in Kazakhstan by producer (thousand tons) Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights, Ministry of Energy RK. © 2023 S&P Global. 6.14.2 Demand In 2022, Kazakhstan consumed only about two-thirds (1.8 MMt) of the LPGs it produced (2.8"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_NationalReport23_en_132", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\NationalReport23_en.pdf", "text": "MMt), making it a sizable net exporter (see Figure 6.29 Kazakhstan’s LPG balance). However, strong growth in domestic demand has occurred in all regions of Kazakhstan since 2015, with LPG consumption increasing on average by 16% annually through 2021. In 2022, aggregate LPG consumption increased even more sharply, by 21%, driven mainly by higher demand in (vehicle) transportation. Kazakhstan’s Southern zone, the country’s most populous region, was the largest LPG consumer in 2022, accounting for 41% of total consumption, followed by the North-Central region, which is not currently well supplied with pipeline gas (28%), and the Western and Northwestern zones (18% and 11%, respectively) (see Figure 6.30 LPGs consumption by consumption zone in 2022). In 2023, LPG demand continued to increase strongly, with monthly deliveries to the domestic market exceeding historical volumes over past several years in almost every month during January-July 2023. Correspondingly, exports of LPGs (mostly by TCO and Zhaikmunay) have declined so far in 2023 relatively to historical monthly figures. Sectorally, LPG consumption in automobile transport (i.e., LPG use as motor fuel in private vehicles) appears to be the largest consumption segment, accounting for about 36% of demand in 2022, followed by the residential sector (e.g., home heating and cooking; 21% of demand), the oil and gas sector itself (16%), and industry (10%) (see Figure 6.31 LPG consumption by sector in 2022). LPGs use in petrochemical sector currently remains limited; in 2021, the sector consumed a mere 2,700 tons of LPGs, although up significantly from only 200 tons in 2020. 114 However, petrochemicals are expected to be an area of major demand growth in the future, starting with the launch of the KPI polypropylene plant in 2022 and other new facilities that are under construction, including a large polyethylene plant (also in Atyrau Oblast; see below and Section 6.10.2) Use of LPG in the transport sector has been expanding rapidly in recent years, reflecting the relatively low retail price for LPGs compared to gasoline (see Figure 6.32 Registered light vehicles in Kazakhstan by type of fuel used). Autogas (retail sales) usage has become quite significant in recent years, reaching over 539,000 tons in 2022 (almost a 10% increase year on year). 115 According to the Ministry of Energy, in 2022 the total number of vehicles running on LPGs increased by almost 57% to 490,000 vehicles (from 313,000 in 2021). Meanwhile, according to Kazakhstan’s National Bureau of Statistics, during 2015-22, the number of LPG-fueled passenger cars nationwide increased nearly sevenfold, reaching just under 350,000 vehicles, or 8% of the total car fleet. In 2022, 2,195 filling stations in Kazakhstan provided LPG fueling services, a nearly threefold increase since 2015 (from 754) (see Figure 6.33 Number of LPGs filling stations by region). It is unclear why the number of stations declined, compared to 2021 (perhaps the definition was changed). According to the latest available data, the value of LPG sales at filling stations was 7.3% of the total value of sold fuels in 2021, compared with only 2.4% in 2015. The share of LPGs sold at filling stations—as opposed to other outlets—reached 63% of total LPG consumption in Kazakhstan in 2021, up from 55% in 2015. These trends likely continued in 2022-23. Southern Kazakhstan had the greatest number of LPG filling stations in 2022 (1,058), while Western Kazakhstan had the most LPG-fueled cars (~133,000). 114 Kazakhstan’s National Statistics Bureau reported that no LPGs were used in the petchem sector in 2022.115 The share of LPG in the total volume of motor fuel sales at filling stations in Kazakhstan rose from 5.6% in 2015 to 12.6% in 2021. Comparable data for 2022 are not available from Kazakhstan’s National Statistical Agency. 194 Figure 6.29 Kazakhstan’s LPG balance (thousand tons) Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global.

Figure 6.33 Number of LPGs filling stations by region Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights, Kazakhstan’s Bureau of National Statistics. © 2023 S&P Global. 196 6.14.3 Market structure and pricing dynamics Since 2019, Kazakhstan’s domestic LPG market has been going through a transition from highly regulated to semi-liberalized, but the pace has varied over time. The liberalization drive aims at four key objectives: ►increase wholesale producer prices to incentivize plant modernization and output expansion ►reduce the share of the overall value chain captured by intermediaries (gas distributors) ►strengthen competition ►increase transparency in deliveries to the market. In 2018, the Law “On Gas and Gas Supply” was amended to introduce LPG trading through electronic trading platforms (ETPs), with LPG exchange trading commencing in February 2019. By the end of 2019, ~15% of LPGs were sold via exchanges; by the end of 2021, that share had increased to ~70%. 116 By early 2022, practically all LPG trade (except for LPG sales to special categories of household consumers and petrochemical enterprises that remained under state regulation) had transitioned to electronic trading. Nonetheless, LPG pricing has proven to be a sensitive and sometimes contentious issue for Kazakhstan, with rapid price rises in 2021 prompting the outbreak of political unrest in January 2022. During 2021, the average retail price paid by consumers for LPG nearly doubled, rising from 60.1 tenge/liter in December 2020 to 111.8 tenge/liter in December 2021 (see Figure 6.34 LPG prices at gas filling stations by region in 2021 and Figure 6.35 Average LPG retail prices in Kazakhstan by month in 2019-23). Yet despite the increase, Kazakh prices still remained relatively low compared to other countries. In November 2021, the average retail LPG price in Kazakhstan was still only about $0.21 per liter compared with $0.85"}

After the January 2022 unrest in Kazakhstan, the government stepped back in to directly regulate the domestic LPG market. It instituted a number of measures, including: ►Suspending LPG sales on exchanges. ►Reducing the regulated wholesale price (“regulated LPG ceiling price outside of exchanges”) for LPGs from 38,700 to 28,000 tenge/ton ($89.24 to $64.57/ton), but on 1 July 2022 the ceiling was raised to 33,600 tenge/ton ($70.58/ton), and it was further raised to 40,320 tenge/ton ($90.57/ton ex.VAT) in July 2023 (see Figure 6.36 Average monthly LPG prices in Kazakhstan). 117 ►Establishing a price corridor for LPG retail prices in a range of 50-75 tenge/liter (depending upon oblast); in July 2023 the retail price corridor shifted higher to 54-81 tenge/liter (without VAT). 118►Suspending trading rules until 1 January 2023 (the rules were canceled altogether in June 2022), 119 with the Ministry of Energy directly regulating LPG trading outside of trading exchanges: 120 The Ministry of Energy determined a plan for LPG deliveries to the domestic market and set wholesale prices jointly with the Ministry of National Economy. 121 ►Amending the Standard Rules for Exchange Trading on 19 July 2022, setting limits on acceptable price movements during trading. 122 ►Initiating an amendment to the LPG supply plan, expanding the list of entities entitled to buy either at wholesale or retail prices (this was finalized and adopted in June 2023). After these interventions in 2022, prices began to recede, except in West Kazakhstan and Atyrau oblasts, where they moved up to more closely reflect national-level prices. 123 As a consequence, vehicle switching to LPGs from gasoline continued to be strong because of the relatively low LPG prices and robust economic growth. By 2023, the government began to cautiously move to raise prices again, increasing the regulated LPG ceiling price outside of exchanges to 40.32 thousand tenge/ton (excluding VAT) for the period from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024. Similarly, on the sidelines of a government meeting on 29 August 2023, Energy Minister Almasadam Satkaliev announced a plan to increase the prices received by producers of LPGs “to at least the [break-even] cost-price level, within three years.” 124 With respect to exchange trading, the plans to re-introduce the system were pushed back to 2025. Meanwhile, the government refined the mechanism for LPGs allocations and continued direct LPGs wholesale and retail price regulation. The Ministry of Energy assumed the responsibility for setting ceiling prices for retail sales of LPG as part of the supply plan outside commodity exchanges; previously this function was with KREM. 116 The main LPGs trading platforms were the ETS and CCE exchanges, as well as the Alan-Trade electronic trading platform. 117 https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/V2300032904. 118 https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/V2200028710.119 https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/V2200026409#z3.120 On 19 July 2022 the LPGs exchange trading rules were added to the order “On the Approval of the Model Rules of Exchange Trading.” https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/V2200028847#z15. 121 TCO and Nostrum are excluded from this process, as they operate under PSAs. 122 https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/V2200028847#z8. 123 Although LPG prices in West Kazakhstan Oblast and Atyrau Oblast have historically been lower than in other parts of the country (reflecting their proximity to LPG production sites), in 2022 prices in western Kazakhstan converged with prices in the southern and north-central parts of the country. 124 https://kapital.kz/economic/118620/stoimost-szhizhennogo-neftyanogo-gaza-budut-postepenno-povyshat-min-energo.html. 197 Figure 6.34 LPG prices at gas filling stations by region in 2021 (tenge per liter) Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights, Situational-Analytical Center of the Fuel & Energy Complex of RK. © 2023 S&P Global.

In our base-case outlook, Kazakhstan’s LPG production almost doubles, reaching almost 5.7 MMt by 2035 but then slowly declines thereafter to about 5.1 MMt in 2050 (see Figure 6.37 Kazakhstan's LPG balance to 2050). This is equivalent to an annual average rate of growth of approximately 4.1% during 2022-35, and 2.1% over the entire 2022-50 period. Key drivers for higher LPG output are the new petrochemical operations planned for this period, and their substantial demand for feedstock. Many of the new petrochemical operations will be producing LPG feedstock from their own separation facilities (for example, a new gas separation unit for the integrated gas-chemical complex in Atyrau [Phase 2]). LPG production by petrochemical operations is expected to grow quite rapidly, reaching about 2.1 MMt/y in 2035 (see Table 6.17 Kazakhstan's major LPG-based petrochemical projects). In contrast, LPG output by GPZs (from associated gas processing) is expected to grow slightly, but it is tied to the amount of gas being processed, so it resembles the trajectory of commercial gas production in the country. Finally, LPG output from refineries is expected to increase only moderately, expanding with refinery throughput. Given that much of petrochemical operations will meet their own needs from their own production, while aggregate LPG demand elsewhere is expected to remain fairly flat (increasing in some sectors like transportation, while declining in others, such as electric power and residences receiving piped gas) (see below), Kazakhstan is expected to remain a sizable exporter of LPGs (~2.0 MMt/y in 2035 and ~1.2 MMt/y in 2050). However, given that some LPGs producers, most notably TCO and Zhaikmunay, are likely to continue to export because of a continued difference in prices between domestic markets and global export markets, it should not be ruled out that imports may become more significant in the future. 199 Figure 6.37 Kazakhstan’s LPG balance to 2050 (thousand tons per year) Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global.

However, Kazakhstan should still be able to import some Russian LPG volumes (in the event of a deficit), as long as it can compete on price with export markets.Consumption outlook. In our base-case outlook, Kazakhstan’s LPG consumption in 2035 more than doubles from 2022 levels, reaching 3.6 MMt, with the emerging petrochemical sector driving much of the growth. Subsequently, consumption growth moderates somewhat, rising by only about 10%, to reach 3.9 MMt in 2050. Despite the robust growth in demand, projected to average roughly 7% annually to 2035 (and 3.6% on average during 2022-50), domestic production should be sufficient to cover consumption (in aggregate). Some LPG exports occurring under PSAs could be accessed at export-parity prices as necessary to meet demand. Some LPG volumes also could be available for import from Russia (or other neighboring countries that currently export like Turkmenistan) if necessary (although this would also be at export-parity prices). 125 The petrochemical sector will be the largest incremental source of domestic demand, rising to 1.9 MMt in 2035, assuming all planned projects launch (albeit with some delays from announced schedules), and then increasing more slowly to 2.1 MMt by 2050 (see Figure 6.38 Kazakhstan's LPG demand outlook by sector to 2050). 126 Consumption of LPGs outside of petrochemicals is likely to remain fairly flat due to a number of countervailing trends across the different sectors: ►With the build-out of natural gas pipelines, LPG can be gradually replaced by piped gas in households, the commercial sector, and eventually in industry for their fuel needs, such as in North-Central Kazakhstan, thus reducing demand for LPGs. ►LPG use in motor vehicles is projected to grow, albeit at a slowing pace with increased penetration. But growth is expected to be stronger in the near to medium term from fuel switching, especially if LPG prices continue to be more heavily regulated while gasoline prices rise. ►Other possibilities for increasing domestic consumption of LPGs could emerge, including small-scale electric power generation, especially near sites of LPG production. Figure 6.38 Kazakhstan’s LPG demand outlook by sector to 2050 (thousand tons) Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights. © 2023 S&P Global. 126 Most of the LPG consumption by industry falls within the petrochemicals sector. 201 6.15 High-Level Takeaways ►The government of Kazakhstan is commended for moving forward with several policy amendments that improve gas market functionality. The next steps should be keeping track and evaluating the success generated by new legislation and adjusting it as necessary. For example, has the adoption of the Improved Model Contract resulted in significant interest and signed contracts from IOCs? Is the new price for new gas sufficient to cover expenses of the new production? In assessing the success of IMC, it is important to keep in mind the broader international context where Kazakhstan competes for investments with other countries. ►Kazakhstan’s government increased gas prices to end-consumers in 2023, but they are still not high enough to cover the costs throughout the value chain. The policy momentum to gradually increase prices, albeit at a differentiated pace for different groups of consumers, should allow prices to more quickly reach cost recovery levels and then economic levels, and should help encourage consumers to use natural gas more efficiently. ►Given the impeding deadline for creating a common gas market in the EAEU by 2025, and the resultant gas pricing harmonization with Russia, prices in western Kazakhstan should be set on a trajectory that will approach thosein Russian gas-producing regions (e.g., Yamal-Nenets Okrug) rather than in that country's neighboring gas-consuming regions (Saratov Oblast); this will help ensure the competitiveness of Kazakhstan's gas in the common economic space. ►Given the primary goal of increasing the availability of sales gas through increased gas processing, it is surprising that incentives for new gas processing have not been more fully incorporated into the new legislation (e.g., Improved Model Contract). It probably will be necessary to provide economic incentives for expansion of gas processing as well as upstream E&P to stimulate growth in commercial gas volumes. At the very least it will be important to send clear signals that investors will be protected against arbitrary unilateral decisions by the state. ►LPG pricing has proven to be a sensitive and sometimes contentious issue for Kazakhstan, with rapid price rises in 2021 prompting the outbreak of political unrest in January 2022. After some retrenchment, by 2023, the government began to cautiously raise prices again, by increasing the regulated LPG ceiling price outside of exchanges. We support Energy Minister Satkaliev’s plan to increase producer prices to at least the [break-even] cost price level within the next three years and a gradual reintroduction of further liberalization policies. These and similar measures will both incentivize production and reduce the threat of unauthorized demand through “grey” exports. 202 Coal is still of crucial importance to the global energy sector despite the development of renewable energy and the implementation of energy transition policies in developed economies, with about 37% of the world's electricity produced from coal and 70% of the world's steel production using coal. Coal, like natural gas, plays an important role in building renewable energy infrastructure and supporting"}

Coal prices, its availability and abundance are critical to the social development of developing countries. The energy crisis and natural gas supply problems in 2022 have shown that coal remains a stabilizing factor in energy markets. The unprecedented increase in coal prices in 2022 and ongoing strong demand in the EU has signi\u0000cantly increased opportunities for Kazakh coal exports. Coal shipment to European countries partially helped the EU to oﬀset the loss of coal exports from Russia. Kazakhstan exported 3888.16 thousand by 3.9 million tons of coal to the EU in 2022, and in the future it is planned to increase the volume of shipments to the EU. Investment is needed to develop the industry, which will pay oﬀ when exports expand and price restrictions are partially lifted on the domestic market. 7.1 Key points ► Until stable energy generation technologies (e.g. thermonuclear energy) or creation of fundamentally new energy storage technologies appear, coal cannot be excluded from the global energy balance; ► Coal allows Kazakhstan's industry to maintain competitiveness due to one of the lowest costs of electricity generated by coal-\u0000red power plants; ► The policy of restraining the coal prices in the domestic market allows to maintain low cost of energy but limits the possibility of investment in the development of coal mines; ► According to the World Coal Association, it is possible to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 2 billion tons of C ₂ by О upgrading existing coal- \u0000red power plants to the best available technologies. Kazakhstan can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by modernizing coal-\u0000red power plants; ► Increased production of high-calorie Shubarkol coal allows for increased exports to non-CIS countries. In addition to Russia, promising export destinations are: Turkey, European countries and Uzbekistan; ► Establishment of new semi-coke production facilities will reduce the high share of semi-coke imports from Russia used in the metallurgical industry; ► Implementation of the best available technologies at coal mining enterprises will reduce the cos t of \u0000eld development and the environmental impact of the coal mining industry. 7.2 Industry regulation Kazakhstan's coal industry is currently the main source of energy for the national economy, accounting for more than 55% of primary energy consumption and 68% of electricity generation in 2022. Almost the entire range of coal production is represented in Kazakhstan - from lignite and sub-bituminous coal for power generation to metallurgical coal and coking coal for blast furnaces. The coal industry, unlike the oil and gas industry, does not have a \"state company\" or \"national operator\", but about 40% of production is accounted for by the largest coal producer in Bogatyr Komir LLP, owned by the state-owned JSC \"Samruk- energy\" and the Russian company \"RUSAL\". The mining industry is regulated under the Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan \"On Subsoil and Subsoil Use\" and is predominantly controlled by the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructural Development. While there is no direct regulation of prices in the domestic coal market, in Kazakhstan the state actually restrains the growth of coal prices. The mechanism of restraint is carried out by monitoring the prices of market players, which according to the legislation can be recognized as dominant. ¹ Even not the largest coal mining companies can be de\u0000ned as dominant participants of the regional coal market. According to the antimonopoly legislation, unjus ti\u0000ed price growth of coal mining companies may be recognized as abuse and direct violation of antimonopoly legislation. As a result of restraining the growth of the cost of coal shipment to consumers of the domestic market may lag behind the in\u0000ation rate. A number of enterprises ship coal to domestic market consumers at prices even below the cost of production. The government is currently considering the introduction of price regulation in the power-generating coal market. This measure may have negative consequences for investments in modernization and upgrade of coal mining enterprises. In terms of taxation, the rent tax on coal exports, which was in eﬀect earlier, has been replaced by the mineral extraction tax (MET). In case of using power-generating coal to produce electrical or thermal energy or to process coal (hard coal (except for coking coal and anthracite), brown coal, oil shale), a reduction factor of 0.01 is applied to the established rate. COAL INDUSTRY 7. COAL INDUSTRY AVANTGARDE ADVISORY 1 Аccording to the Entrepreneurial Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan: The position of a market entity whose share in the relevant product market is thirty- \u0000ve percent or more is recognized as dominant. 204 7.3 Coal basins reserves Having rich coal reserves, Kazakhstan is one of the world leaders in coal production and consumption. The State Balance Sheet lists 49 coal deposits and coal-bearing areas. According to available data, coal reserves under categories A+B+C1 (which is equivalent to the category of \"proven and probable\" reserves) amount to 29.3 billion tons. Kazakhstan ranks tenth in the world in terms of coal reserves, which will last for more than 250 years at current production rates. The largest coal basins - Ekibastuz (10.1 billion tons), Karaganda (7.0 billion tons) and Turgai (5.9 billion tons) - are located in central and northern Kazakhstan. Ekibastuz Basin coal mines are particularly notable for their low production costs: the coal beds are thick and close to the surface, which facilitates the use of traditional open-pit mining methods. However, coals of Ekibastuz basin, containing 45.8% of Kazakhstan's power generating coal reserves, are characterized by very high ash content (42-44%), and the ash is highly abrasive, which leads to increased wear of boiler heating surfaces when burning coal in dusty state. Coals of Ekibastuz basin belong to low-enriched coals, which limits the possibility of its enrichment by traditional methods. Reserves of coals suitable for coking are concentrated mainly in the Karaganda basin (90.5%). Most of the coals of the Karaganda basin due to their high technological properties are cla ssi\u0000ed as high quality raw materials for the coke-chemical industry. Unlike coals of Ekibastuz basin, coal of Shubarkol deposit is characterized by"}

The 2022 production level is the highest production level in the last ten years. 70-75% of Kazakhstan's coal production is focused on the domestic market, but due to the energy crisis in Europe, demand for coal has increased signi\u0000cantly, however, logistical problems have arisen. According to the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development, there are 25 coal mining enterprises in the country, with three quarters of national production concentrated in four enterprises: Bogatyr Komir LLP, Eurasian Energy Corporation (ERG), Shubarkol Komir JSC and ArcelorMittal T emirtau JSC. The largest coal producer in Kazakhstan is Bogatyr Komir LLP, which is developing the giant Bogatyr open pit mine in the Ekibastuz basin. In 2022, the company's production volume amounted to 42.5 million tons or about 40% of the national production. In 2022, the company introduced a new cyclic -\u0000ow technology (CFT), which enabled the transition from coal transportation by rail to conveyor transportation. The transition to the cyclic -\u0000ow technology increased the degree of averaging of coal from diﬀerent-quality coal beds using crushing equipment and will ensure the stability of the quality of shipped coal due to the automation of control processes. The project increased the design capacity of the Bogatyr open pit mine by 8 million tons and signi\u0000cantly reduced dust generation and operating costs. The second largest coal producer is Eurasian Resources Group (ERG), which accounts for about a quarter of the country's total coal production through two holdings: Eurasian Energy Corporation JSC (EEC) and Shubarkol Komir JSC. Slightly more than 1/5 of production is accounted for by three other producers: F\u0000gure 7 .1 Kazakhstan's coal b as\u0000ns © 2021 IHS Markit. All rights reserved. COAL INDUSTRY 205 F\u0000gure 7 .2 Coal extr act\u0000on \u0000n Kazakhstan the Coal Department of ArcelorMittal T emirtau JSC, Kazakhmys Coal LLP and Maikuben West LLP. Karazhyra JSC, which operates in the East Kazakhstan region, produces around 6% nationwide . In 2017 - 2022, large coal mining companies increased production by 8%, at the same time the companies have reached their design capacity and further increase in production volumes will be associated with signi\u0000cant investments. It is impossible to attract investments for coal projects from a wide range of international \u0000nancial organizations due to restrictions imposed on investments in hydrocarbon fuel production. In recent years, the Kazakhstan industry has seen a trend towards the introduction of dry coal preparation plants. The pilot introduction of this technology began in the 2010s at the Karazhyra deposit, now a number of coal mining companies are planning to introduce dry coal preparation technology, including the construction of a dry coal preparation complex at the Bogatyr deposit at the Severny open pit mine with a capacity of up to 2 million tons of coal per year. Large coal mines could increase coal production by 2030 by 12 million tons, out of which : ► 4 million tons of increased coal production by Bogatyr-Komir LLP to supply coal to the planned new coal-\u0000red power units; ► 2 million tons of increased production at Maikuben West JSC will be directed to the domestic market and increased supplies to Russia and Uzbekistan; ► 2 million tons of coal production at JSC Karazhyra will probably be directed to the domestic market; ► 2.2 million tons of coal production at JSC Karazhyra will probably be directed to the domestic market; ► it is also planned to increase production at Shubarkol Premium JSC by 2 million tons. An important factor aﬀecting the development of the industry is prices in the domestic market and the policy of price restraint, which aﬀects investment in the industry and modernization of production. Given the transition to BAT and the implementation of environmental protection measures, a tangible price increase will be required. Unlike the prices of other fuels, coal prices in Kazakhstan are not directly regulated. However, the government retains oversight over pricing and trading in the coal industry. In Kazakhstan, the transportation of utility coal by railway infrastructure is also subsidized, so price restraint occurs both at the production level and at the level of transportation costs. The National Energy Report 2021 gave a forecast for coal production until 2050: a decrease in production to 69 million tons by 2050 and a decrease in consumption to 56 million tons in 2050. This forecast can be considered as one of the options for the development of the sector but in general the situation with coal consumption depends on the availability and prices of natural gas and the decision on the construction of nuclear power plant, subject to the referendum outcome referendum in the near future. 7.5 Domestic coal consumption Coal plays a critical role in Kazakhstan's economy: in 2022, it still accounted for 52% of the country's total primary energy consumption. The main consumers of coal are coal-\u0000red power plants, whose consumption in 2022 accounted for 57.5 million tons of coal, while boiler houses consumed 6.9 million tons of coal. Industrial sector coal consumption amounted to 6.0 million tons of coal, the municipal sector and population accounted for 11.0 million tons of coal. Coal from the Ekibastuz basin is the main source for 10.9 GW , 1.9 GW of coal-\u0000red power plants operate on coal from the Karaganda basin, and another 0.6 GW of coal-\u0000red power plants operate on coal from the Karazhira deposit.

As a result, coal consumption by the energy sector may increase by 5 million tons. Increase in the design capacity of Bogatyr mine allows to fully oﬀset this increase in coal consumption. Commissioning of new coal-\u0000red capacity will be accompanied by gradual decommissioning of GRES power units with a high level of wear and tear and long service life, besides, in case of NPP construction, coal-\u0000red generation at GRES will be gradually displaced. After 2035, the growth of coal capacity will be oﬀset by the gradual retir ement of coal-\u0000red generation with long equipment service life. The peak of domestic coal consumption is forecasted until 2035, then the consumption will decrease, which will depend more on the commissioning of NPP capacities. In industry, especially in the mining and metallurgical sector, coal consumption will decrease, so the implementation of the \"Hydropolymet\" project at the Ridder metallurgical plant will lead to a signi\u0000cant reduction in the consumption of coal and coal coke. Kazakhstan's development of direct iron reduction technologies using natural gas will also reduce coal consumption. For example, SSGPO JSC is implementing a project in the city of Rudny to build a plant for direct reduction of iron from iron ore raw materials, with a total capacity of 1.8 million tons of metal per year. Gradual ga si\u0000cation of regions and population will aﬀect the reduction of coal consumption, however, the high cost of natural gas compared to coal will be the main deterrent to the substitution of coal with natural gas in the housing and utilities sector. An important factor of the domestic coal market is the actual restraint of coal sales prices from mining enterprises and cross- subsidization of railroad transportation of coal. If measures to administratively restrain coal prices are lifted, the price of coal on the domestic market could increase by an estimated 30-40%. It is unlikely that coal price regulation and cross-subsidization of coal transportation at the expense of other commodities will be terminated in the coming years. The Agency for the Protection and Development of Competition in the Republic of Kazakhstan regularly inspects any unusual coal price spikes for residential consumers. The government periodically discusses direct regulation of power generating coal prices on the domestic market, but this measure would have negative consequences for the development of the coal industry. 7.6 Coal export Although Kazakhstan has impressive coal reserves, most of coal is characterized by high moisture and ash content, which signi\u0000cantly limits its export opportunities. The main export markets (China and EU) have ash and sulphur content requirements, so most of the coal mined in Kazakhstan is not competitive on the global market. Most coal is exported to Russia from the Ekibastuz basin, as coal-\u0000red power plants in the South Urals and Western Siberia were designed to burn Ekibastuz coal. Over the past decade, Kazakhstan has exported about a quarter of its annual production but this \u0000gure has been gradually declining. In 2010, exports accounted for about 31% of productio n, but its share fell to about 25% in the middle of the decade, and from 2018 to only 20-21%. However, in 2020, coal exports rose to 28% of production. The export structure has changed over the past \u0000ve years, while Russia used to account for 78-80% of Kazakhstan's coal exports, Russia's share has fallen to 70% in 2021. Coal exports to Uzbekistan increased to 1.2 million tons (5% of exports), and the share of exports to non-CIS countries increased to 18% (5.5 million tons), the increase in exports was to Switzerland (up to 4.3 million tons - 14%). The situation with coal exports has changed signi\u0000cantly in 2022, as a result of the energy crisis, the volume of coal exports to non- CIS countries increased to 9.3 million tons, the largest increase occurred in Switzerland (up to 6 million tons), Poland, Cyprus, Turkey and Belgium.

COAL INDUSTRY 207 Table 7 .2 Coal exports by country 2017 - 2022, mln tons The outlook for the European coal market is very signi\u0000cant, with expected demand growth exceeding 40 million tons, while the price level has been maintained at a high level since the outbreak of military actions in Ukraine. Due to the con\u0000ict in Ukraine and the subsequent natural gas supply crisis, there was a record increase in coal prices in 2022. Thus, the key quotation for of API 2 coal imported to Northwest Europe reached an all-time high on March 08, 2022 (438.35 $/t), re\u0000ecting more of a panic in the market . By autumn the situation stabilized and a decline was achieved at 267 $/t on October 28, 2022. The increase in coal demand during winter 2022 and early 2023 in European countries has of course led to an increase in the cost of coal, but in the horizon of the next few years, stabilization in the energy market will be achieved gradually , which will put downward pressure on the coal market. According to McCloskey forecasts, the decrease in coal prices in the European market will be achieved within two years due to stabilization of energy resources supplies. Stabilization of supplies of energy resources even if the military and political crisis in Ukraine drags on, will be achieved by \u0000lling coal capacities in the EU and gradually increasing coal imports, including from the USA. Even with lower prices and stabilization of the EU"}

In addition to the energy sector, Turkey's cement industry is a major consumer of coal - the country is the 7th largest cement producer in the world. Turkey is one of the largest importers of coal, in view of the plans to develop coal energy, cement industry and other consumers under the current environmental legislation it is possible to forecast further increase of Kazakhstan coal exports to Turkey. 7.7 Coal transportation Tariﬀs for railroad transportation in Kazakhstan are regulated by the Committee for Regulation of Natural Monopolies of the Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Tariﬀs for coal are usually set below the average for all other cargoes transported by rail, taking into account its signi\u0000cant share (25%) in the total volume of railroad transportation and its status as a socially important commodity. The tariﬀ for railroad transportation consists of three components: mainline railroad network services, locomotive traction services and provision of freight cars (containers). Railway network services are regulated and diﬀerentiated by track sections (with a division into elec tri\u0000ed and non-elec tri\u0000ed) from 2021, while the regulation of freight car services was abolished in 2017. In turn, regulation of locomotive traction services is retained, but diﬀerentiated tariﬀs for diﬀerent types of traction (divided into diesel and electric locomotive) and fuel are in place as of 2021. According to Kazakhstan's national railway company Kazakhstan T emir Zholy (KTZ), the tariﬀ for locomotive traction using oil products (diesel fuel) is 4.6 times higher than the same tariﬀ for coal. In December 2020, the Committee for the Regulation of Natural Monopolies approved new tariﬀs for freight transportation by rail for 2021-2025, indicating that the average tariﬀ will increase by 13% in 2021, while tariﬀs for coal and grain will only increase by 4- 6% (essentially in line with the in\u0000ation rate forecast ). In addition, KTZ has oﬃcially separated freight operations from passenger transportation, and cross-subsidization of passenger transportation is now explicitly outlined. 7.8 Accidents at coal mines The coal of the Karaganda basin is characterized by high methane content, and mining is accompanied by constant accidents with serious injuries and deaths of miners. Despite the legal requirement to degasify coal beds prior to mining, accidents with human casualties occur annually at ArcelorMittal T emirtau JSC (AMT) coal mines. Thus, on August 17, 2023 at the mine “Kazakhstanskaya”, owned by AMT there was a \u0000re at the time when 227 people were underground. The accident at the \"Kazakhstanskaya\" mine killed \u0000ve people, and in 2022 the accident at the \"Lenin\" mine killed \u0000ve people, in 2021 the accident at the \"Abayskaya\" mine claimed the lives of 6 miners. For comparison, according to the US Department of Labor, mining about 590 million tons of coal in 2020 killed 5 miners, and in Kazakhstan 6 miners died in ArcelorMitall T ermirtau alone mining 8 million tons of coal in 2022. The tragedies at the mines are not an exception in the company's practice, according to the parliamentarians, more than 100 people have already died in the 15 years of ArcelorMitall T ermirtau's operations. According to Basin V. B., deputy akim of Karaganda region: - \"Investments to replace equipment, to upgrade equipment, to decommission equipment that has exhausted its \u0000eet life , are very few. In the last three years, investments have averaged 100 billion tenge (about $210 million). However, taking into account the size of the plant, its composition, and its coal department - 8 mines, including surface plants, and the ore department with 4 mines keeping in mind problems we have today, this is not enough\" ¹, It is characteristic that the data of national statistics show s a signi\u0000cant reduction in occupational mortality in Kazakhstan, but Figure 7 . 3 Change in the API2 quotation from January to October 2022.

As a result of ongoing accidents at AMT enterprises, the President of Kazakhstan K.-J. T okayev questioned further operation of this investor in Kazakhstan. Continuous accidents at the above mentioned enterprises owned by the foreign company indicate a serious violation of its investment and other obligations with corresponding consequences for further operation in the Kazakhstan market. Currently, the Government of Kazakhstan is negotiating with the shareholders of ArcelorMittal the termination of their activities in the country and the sale of their asset. 7.9 Development of the coal industry in Kazakhstan Increase in coal production is also accompanied by technological development of coal mining enterprises and creation of production facilities with deep coal processing and development of the domestic market of coal products, in particular coal semi- coke (special coke). In Kazakhstan, coking coal is used to produce coke, which is then used in the production of steel and cast iron. Coke is also widely used in the production of other metals, including aluminum and copper. All coke produced in Kazakhstan is fully consumed by ArcelorMittal T emirtau's metallurgical operations. Main volume of semi-coke ² is consumed in the domestic market, while such enterprises as Aksu Ferroalloy Plant JSC (Pavlodar region), Aktobe Ferroalloy Plant JSC (Aktobe region), Kazzinc LLP (East Kazakhstan region) import the main volume of semi-coke from Russia. Russia is the key supplier of semi-coke to Kazakhstan, however, due to the tightening of environmental requirements in China since 2020 the production of semi-coke is reduced and imports from Russia will increase. Russian producers bene\u0000t more from the Chinese and Indian markets than supplies to Kazakhstan, so supplies to Kazakhstan are gradually decreasing from 2020. The main producer of semi-coke used in the metallurgical industry is Shubarkol Komir JSC, which produced 212.5 thousand tons of semi-coke in 2020. By 2024, Shubarkol Komir JSC plans to build another plant in Karaganda region to produce semi-coke with a design capacity of 400 thousand tons per year and 70 thousand tons of coal tar and oil per year, obtained from coal of Shubarkol deposit. It is also planned to launch T emir Coke LLP with a design capacity of 43 thousand tons of semi-coke per year. The increase in semi-coke production is promising and enables the Kazakh industry to fully switch to the use of its own products. In terms of technological development, taking into account the plans for transition to BAT principles, it is currently recommended to consider the following options for the industry: Dry coal preparation Dry coal preparation technologies involve coal preparation without the use of water. Such plants include pneumatic, magnetic and electromagnetic coal preparation equipment ³. The principle of operation of the pneumatic coal preparation plant is separation of particles by density in the upwar d air \u0000ow. During the separation process the particles are separated according to the set density boundary. The plant allows to separate waste rock and high ash coal from low ash coal. Pneumatic coal preparation plants can be quite compact, so in the future they can be installed directly at open-pit mines or in mines. Dry coal preparation is applied at Karazhyra deposit at FGX-24A preparation complex (capacity of 240 tons/hour), which allowed to increase the production volume by 300-400 thousand tons of coal per year. Dry coal preparation unit is planned to be put into pilot operation at Bogatyr Komir LLP. 3 https://24.kz/ru/news/social/item/551039-na-predpriyatiyakh-amt-za-15-let- pogibli-bolee-100-chelovek 2 other name medium-temperature coke (special coke) COAL INDUSTRY 3 In Russia, 2 out of 62 large coal preparation plants operate on dry enrichment technology. 210 Conveyor transportation Conveyor transportation is characterized by the lowest labor costs among all types of quarry transport. Belt conveyors are used to transport coal, waste rock and rock from tunneling, stripping and mining faces along horizontal and inclined workings inside mining enterprises, to lift them to the surface and to further move them to the preparation plant, to the loading point of external transport or directly to the consumer, while rock is moved to the dump. It is a structure consisting of support legs, drive and tension drums, drive equipment, intermediate support rollers and a circular belt on which the loads are directly moved. Implementation of conveyor lines allows to signi\u0000cantly reduce transportation costs and reduce pollutant emissions and dusting. Digital model of the deposit When developing coal deposits, an important factor is the availability of an up-to-date model of the deposit, its structure, dumps, embankments, etc. T o increase the eﬃciency of surveying works it makes sense to use geodetic UAVs for airborne surveying and appropriate software that allows to interpret the images and point cloud into a 3D model. The use of UAVs in combination with modern software for modeling of coal mines will increase the eﬃciency of surveying works, reduce the time for their implementation, increase their frequency and accuracy. In turn, the availability of an up-to-date model of the mine, knowledge of its geology, structure and sizes of embankments and dumps will increase the eﬃciency of \u0000eld development planning. Industrial safety systems Ensuring occupational and production safety is the most important task, as human life is the most important value. Coal mining is associated with round-the-clock movement of a large number of machinery and transport, the latest technologies to ensure industrial safety are: ► Driver fatigue monitoring system allows to recognize the driver's concentration level, detect smoking, use of mobile devices while driving. If any abnormalities are detected, the system warns the driver and transmits information to the control center . ► Proximity warning system allows to minimize the risks of machinery collision with a person by signaling the proximity both to the person and to the driver or operator of the machinery. ► Surround-view cameras make it easier to maneuver quarry equipment and vehicles, and video recorders increase driver vigilance and allow f or accurate identi\u0000cation"}

In terms of technologies that can be attributed to BAT, it is recommended to consider the following areas: Dust suppression During mining operations, the impact of air and noise pollution on workers and local communities can be minimized by using modern mine planning techniques and special equipment. Dust levels can be controlled by spraying water on roads, stockpiles and conveyors. Other steps can also be taken, including equipping drilling rigs with dust collection systems and acquiring additional land around the mine as a buﬀer zone. Trees planted in these buﬀer zones can also minimize the visual impact of mining operations on local communities. Bogatyr Komir LLP is taking measures to reduce dust emissions from its open pit mines, as they directly harm the health of employees. The company has installed a pilot fogging unit that converts drainage and fresh water into fog using a high-pressure pump. This mist then captures and precipitates coal dust, preventing it from spreading. The company plans to introduce six more of these units. Wastewater treatment Coal mining generates large quantities of pit water. Enterprises are working to improve water management in an eﬀort to reduce demand through eﬃciency, technology and the use of lower quality water and recycled water. Water pollution is controlled by carefully separating water runoﬀ from undisturbed areas from water containing sediment or salt from mine workings. Treated wastewater and pit water can be discharged to surrounding water bodies, and it is possible to reuse it in processes such as dust suppression and irrigation of forest plantations. There are mine management practices that can minimize acid mine drainage (AMD), and eﬀective mine design can prevent water from entering acid-forming materials and help prevent AMD. Methane emission control While coal accounts for the majority of total GHG emissions and air emissions in Kazakhstan due to its combustion in the production of electricity and heat, coal mining (both mine and open pit) also has signi\u0000cant environmental impacts - including air quality, solid waste disposal and wastewater discharge. The most signi\u0000cant GHG emissions from coal mining are not so much related to fuel use at facilities, but rather to methane (CH4) emissions that are released from mines and dumps during coal mining, transportation, and preparation. Yet measuring methane emissions during coal mining remains problematic. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that coal mining accounts for about 40 million tons of methane emissions worldwide each year, making it the largest single source of such emissions in the energy sector (although this \u0000gure is lower than the share of the oil and gas sectors combined). Attention should be paid to the use of thermal oxidation technologies to reduce the concentration of ventilation air methane (CMM) that can also play an important role in reducing emissions. Although this is not a new technology: the commercial application of regenerative catalytic oxidation (RCO) and regenerative thermal oxidation of CMM \u0000rst took place at BHP Billington's West Cliﬀ plant in 2007. COAL INDUSTRY 211 The most eﬀective way to control mine methane emissions is to degasify coal beds with drilled boreholes before methane enters the mine workings. The requirement for dega si\u0000cation of coal beds before they are mined is a requirement of Kazakhstan legislation. Thus, Article 153 \"On Subsoil and Subsoil Use\" prohibits the development of coal deposits with an increased level of natural methane content of coal beds without taking the necessary measures for early dega si\u0000cation, ventilation programs and formation dega si\u0000cation with subsequent use of the resulting methane, the reduction of methane content in coal beds to the established standards. 7.10 Key ndings and recommendations ► Coal will remain paramount to Kazakhstan's economy over the next ten years; ► Export potential, taking into account the growing demand in the EU and Turkey, remains high, which allows to increase the volume of coal production from the Shubarkol deposit; ► The policy of price restraint in the domestic coal market limits the ability of coal mining companies to develop and modernize; ► Taking into account the developed metallurgical complex, the development of low-temperature semi-coke production is promising; ► Transition of coal deposits to the BAT principles will require investments and growth of coal prices, it is necessary to raise public awareness of the necessary price increase. COAL INDUSTRY 212 ELECTRICITY 8. ELECTRICITY 8.1 Key points ► In 2022 - 2023, several major accidents occurred at Kazakhstan's energy facilities. In the city of Ekibastuz, an emergency situation was declared due to an accident in the heat supply system; signi\u0000cant problems were also observed in the operation of the Ridder combined heat and power plant (CHP). A number of other incidents involving power plants and power supply systems resulted in curtailing operations of industrial consumers. Based on the analysis of accidents, the government of Kazakhstan decided to legislate the eventuality of seizing energy facilities from their owners in case of their improper condition or operation. ► In 2023, the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan completed a large-scale technical audit of all Kazakhstan's power plants (including CHPs), based on which international consultants determined that wear and tear of CHP's main equipment was extremely high. However, the audit method- ology and the results obtained raised questions among experts. Based on the data collected during the preparation of this report, the situation with the main equipment does not look as critical as the audit results suggest. More than 47% of turbines have been commissioned after 1991, but the power plants' main problems stem from the high wear and tear of auxiliary equipment and infrastructure, ¹ the modernisation of which is not covered by the capacity market mechanism at present. ► Heat energy tariﬀs, constrained by government regulation, do not cover the full extent of required replacement of"}

Most heating networks are on the balance sheets of municipal authorities with a share of repairs (up to 50%) directly covered by the city budgets. As a result, heating networks that are privately owned cannot be modernised properly due to tariﬀ restrictions; namely 14% of heating networks that are privately owned are worn out by more than 77%. Notably, the heating networks in the cities of Ekibastuz and Ridder belonged to private companies, whilst at Petropavlovsk CHP- 2, where out of seven turbines three have been installed after 2013, the accident occurred on the auxiliary equipment - the chimney. ► The issues with tariﬀ restrictions also aﬀect the electric power transmission and distribution sector, where the level of wear and tear of the grid assets operated by regional electricity companies (REC) in 2022 exceeded 65%. The production and transportation of the heat energy, as well as the transmission of electricity fall within the natural monopo- lies regulation, where, despite the introduction of a regulated asset base (RAB) methodology ² the cost-plus approach governs in practice. Moreover, according to the current tariﬀ- setting rules the allowed pr o\u0000t cannot be paid to the shareholders in the form of dividends, but must be used to fund investment programs. As a result, the network companies operate with virtually zero pr o\u0000ts for the owners, who, in some cases, receive income through non-transparent business and procurement schemes. Moreover, due to the de\u0000ciencies of the cost-plus tariﬀ methodology used in most cases, the network companies' approved tariﬀs do not account for the corporate income tax payment, as a result the companies are forced to pay for it from the pr o\u0000ts intended for investments. The investment sources depleted in this way compromise the delivery of investment commitments and would result in penalties. ► Despite the government's eﬀorts to modernise both generating and network facilities, the industry is characterized by a signi \u0000cant degree of depreciation of \u0000xed assets, relatively low eﬃciency (33-35%) of power production, high electricity losses during power transmission (8%), as well as the shortage of \u0000exible capacity to balance the daily schedule and renewable output. ► Forecasts for electricity shortages that arose in the wake of the cryptocurrency mining growth, as well as the relocation of industrial production and companies from Russia in 2022, are most likely premature, given the capacity reserves, including those in the energy- de\u0000cient Southern Energy zone, where Zhambul GRES' ³ capacity factor remains quite low (20-34%). The commissioning of Ekibastuz GRES-1 unit 1 515 MW after modernisation in 2024 in Northern Energy zone will oﬀset the anticipated load growth in the energy system. The reliability of power supply in the Western Energy zone could be partially resolved by involving T engiz \u0000eld gas turbine power plants' (with the total installed capacity of 488 MW) in the power system's frequency control. The technical re- equipment of MAEK and the construction of highly eﬃcient CCGT units would also help resolve the issues with the power supply in the Western Energy zone ► A fundamental change in the electricity and capacity market model in Kazakhstan has been the 2023 transition to the Single Buyer mechanism, discussed in the previous edition of this report. The Single Buyer purchases electricity from the power plants daily on the basis of competitive selection and sells electricity to the consumers at averaged hourly prices daily. Whereas in a free market the selection of supply is driven by a single factor – the price, the free market mecha- nisms prevent the selection from becoming more detailed and complex to achieve the energy system eﬀects. In comparison, the Single Buyer mechanism makes it possible to implement the principles of multi-criteria optimization using digital technologies, ⁴ which in the future can produce signi\u0000cant 1 Boiler houses, cooling towers, fuel oil (mazut) facilities, buildings and structures, etc. 2 Method of incentive tariﬀ setting based on the pr o\u0000tability of the Regulated Asset Base (RAB). Tariﬀs are formed based on pr o\u0000ts and operating costs, while pro\u0000ts directly depend on the value of assets directly involved in the provision of services. This approach stimulates investment. 3 Installed capacity of the power plant is 1,230 MW, available capacity is 1,107 MW. 4 Multicriteria optimisation is a mathematical programming aimed at \u0000nding the best (optimal) solution that satis\u0000es several criteria that are irreducible to each other.AVANTGARDE ADVISORY AND SEEPX ENERGY 214 systemic eﬀects and surpass the eﬃciency of free market mechanisms. Simultaneously with the launch of a Single Electricity Buyer Mechanism Kazakhstan launched its balancing market in real time. ► When it comes to the long-term development of the electric power industry 2023 signaled a major political step forward - the decision to hold a referendum on the construction of a nuclear power plant. Nuclear energy could become the foundation for replacing the coal-\u0000red generation, which dominates electricity production in Kazakhstan. In addition, the ga si\u0000cation of the regions and possible additional gas supplies from Russia could aﬀect the replacement of coal- \u0000red boiler houses and CHPs in central and eastern Kazakhstan signi\u0000cantly. The energy transition for Kazakhstan denotes not only the development of renewable energy sources, but also the expansion of ga s-\u0000red generating capacity and the construction of nuclear power plants. ► The development of new generation, whether those are nuclear, highly eﬃcient combined cycle ga s-\u0000red or new coal- \u0000red power units, will require tariﬀs suﬃcient to recoup long- term investments, as well as transparency of the tariﬀ-setting process itself. Acceleration of modernisation and renewal of electric power facilities' \u0000xed assets also require reforms, and this chapter will examine not only the problems in the industry, but also propose changes to the legislation. 8.2 Information about the electric power industry Kazakhstan's electricity industry is the largest in the Central Asian region.

There are 64 thermal power plants in operation in the country, of which: 37 are CHPs, that provide heat energy to the population and industrial consumers, 6 condensing power plants (GRES), 11 gas turbine, 8 gas piston, and 2 combined cycle gas units (CCGTs). The development of the oil and gas complex in the west of the country has led to a gradual increase in the share of gas generation in the energy balance, whilst the legislative framework adopted since 2014 to support renewable energy sources (RES) has made it possible to increase the share of renewables, which, according to the law, include wind, solar, small hydroelectric and biogas power plants. Currently, 130 RES with a total capacity of 2,388 MW have been commissioned in the country, of which 46 are wind power plants (WPP), 44 are solar power plants (SPP), 37 are small hydroelec- tric power plants ⁵, and 3 are biogas power plants. By the end of 2025, Kazakhstan plans to increase its renewable capacity to 2,900 MW. Overall, between 2014 and 2022, there has been a 3.6 GW (17%) increase in the installed generating capacity, with renewables accounting for more than 2.4 GW. The development of intermittent energy sources, such as wind and solar power plants, dependent on weather conditions, requires balancing by \u0000exible power plants, the shortage of which has been noted in Kazakhstan even prior 2014. In 2022, Kazakhstan held auctions of \u0000exible power plants' projects with a total capacity of 1,716.5 MW: Kyzylorda CCGT 240 MW, Turkestan CCGT 926.5 MW, Almaty CCGT 480 MW, and Zhezkazgan CCGT 70 MW. Commissioning of these power plants is not envisaged earlier than mid-2026, meanwhile the capacity of intermittent sources (wind and solar power plants) will increase by about 487 MW, which will cause an additional challenge for the energy system balancing. The total capacity of new \u0000exible energy sources after 2026 would be suﬃcient to overcome the shortage of \u0000exible capacity, but only partially, and it would be necessary to develop hydroelec- tric generation as the most eﬀective \u0000exible source of power. According to the plans for the development of hydropower until 2030, Kazakhstan plans to build two re-regulating hydroelectric power stations (HPP): Kerbulak HPP (the counter-regulator for Kapchaigask HPP) and the Bulak HPP (the counter-regulator for Shulbinsk HPP), as well as Semipalatinsk HPP. The shift to renewable auctions as part of the state support of RES development has turned out to be an aﬀective mechanism to put the downward pressure on renewable tariﬀs and enabled for the commissioning of 1900 MW of renewable capacity. In addition to supporting RES within the framework of the current legislation, a number of new projects support their development. In 2023, an intergovernmental agreement was signed with France for the construction of a wind farm and an energy storage system with a capacity of up to 1000 MW (a joint project with T otal), and a principles agreement was signed for the construction of a wind farm and an energy storage system with a capacity of up to 1000 MW (a joint project with Masdar).The RES tariﬀs are warranted by the intergovernmental agreements, whilst balancing is managed by the energy storage systems (ESS) provided for in the projects. The 2021 amendments to the legislation, eﬀectively equalized waste incineration power plants ⁶ to RES. In the same year, auctions for the construction of waste-incinerating (waste-to- energy) power plants were held with a plan to commission 100.8 MW. Auctions with one participant were recognized as valid and con\u0000rmed the electricity tariﬀ of 172.71 tenge/kWh (without VAT), which was several times higher than RES tariﬀs. If waste-to- energy power plants had been built, the cost leading to their support would have amounted to 130 billion tenge annually, which would have been comparable to the total cost of renewable energy sources' support in Kazakhstan. However, in April 2023, the government renounced its plans to build waste-incinerating (waste-to-energy) power plants. On the whole the current support of renewable generation has enabled for the commissioning of 1,100 MW of wind and 1,085 MW of solar generation dependent on weather conditions. Due to the intermittent nature of this generation their output requires balancing by \u0000exible power plants or energy storage. The 5 Hydroelectric power plants with an installed capacity of up to 35 MW, whilst other hydroelectric power plants, according to the law, are not cla ssi\u0000ed as renewable energy sources. 6 In legislation these plants are called “energy waste recycling.”ELECTRICITY 215 Figure 8.1 Changes to capacity and structure of electricity production by fuel type. 10000150002000025000 05000 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022TPP coal TPP (steam turbine) gas GTPP Hydro Wind Solar Bio-gas balancing costs associated with renewable output are the hidden costs associated with their support. The use of energy storage systems to balance wind and solar power plants is not the most optimal solution, due to high costs of storage systems and technical limitations to their operation. Ideally, this unstable generation could be balanced by hydro generation if such could be purposely built in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan within the framework of regional energy cooperation, but such a solution falls more within politics and the integration processes in the Central Asian region in general. In terms of regional structure, the energy system of Kazakhstan is divided into three Energy zones - the united Northern and Southern Energy zones, connected by three 500 kV lines, and the Western Energy zone, which operates independently. The Energy zones generation mix is subject to the type of available fuel, and is as follows: ► Only ga s-\u0000red thermal power plants operate in the Western Energy zone, the location of the country's key oil and gas \u0000elds. Notably, some power plants are the oil and ga s \u0000elds' own sources of electricity and do not supply electricity to"}

The region also has the opportunity to meet part of its consumption by importing electricity from the Uni\u0000ed Energy System of Russia (UES Russia). Thus, the Atyrau energy hub has connections with UES Russia's IPS South (Astrakhan energy hub) via a 110 kV overhead line, and West Kazakhstan region has connections with UES Russia's IPS Middle Volga via three 220 kV overhead lines; ► The main coal mining deposits are concentrated in the Northern Energy zone, including the world's largest coal mine Bogatyr. The backbone of the surplus Northern Energy zone is coal- \u0000red generation, including all coal- \u0000red CPPs ⁷ (traditionally called GRES), as well as hydroelectric power stations in eastern Kazakhstan. About 70% of the country's total generating capacity is concentrated in the Northern Energy zone. The developed electricity network of 220-500- 1150 kV lines, including one connecting the Uni\u0000ed Energy System of Kazakhstan and the IPS Siberia of UES Russia, makes it possible to transmit electricity both to the Southern Energy zone and to exchange \u0000ows with UES Russia. The Northern Energy zone is a home to the main industrial consumers of electricity, including the mining and metallurgi- cal industries; ► The Southern Energy zone is energy de\u0000cient. In terms of electricity consumption, this is the area with the largest share of population, whilst the generation mix is diverse, and consists of both coal-\u0000red and ga s-\u0000red generation, as well as some hydropower. Notably, this zone is a country leader in the development of small hydropower generation. The Southern Energy zone's power de\u0000cit (11.5 billion kWh) is met by the \u0000ows from the Northern Energy zone. Due to climatic conditions, it is most suitable for the development of solar and wind generation. However, the lack of \u0000exible capacity reserves and related existing regulation and balancing issues prevent Kazakhstan from tapping into this environmental capital. The largest ga s-\u0000red power plant Zhambyl GRES, is located in the Southern Energy zone as well. Since 1992 it has been operating ineﬃciently at a reduced load due to issues with the supply of natural gas (initially from Uzbekistan). At the same time, the commission- ing of Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline in 2015 did not solve the issue of low capacity utilization. The consequence of price competition from the coal-\u0000red CPPs in the Northern Energy zone is signi \u0000cant underutilization ⁸ of gas- \u0000red generation even in the energy- de\u0000cient Southern Energy zone. Naturally, investment into modernisation will be required to launch all units at Zhambyl GRES, but the downtime of such a powerful source in an energy- de\u0000cient area greatly reduces the reliability of power supply. Notably, the Energy zones' imbalance is primarily caused by the distribution of generating capacity. In the Northern Energy zone the installed capacity of the power plants is 16.4 GW, whilst in the Southern Energy zone it is only 4.5 GW. The de\u0000cit of the Southern Energy zone is met via three 500 kV North-South transmission lines, but this route is characterised by a regular overload of the power lines. Currently, there is a plan for the complete uni\u0000cation of all three Energy zones by the means of constructing a 500 kV Atyrau- Aktobe overhead line with a length of about 500 km. 7 Condensing power plant (CPP) - a thermal power plant that produces electricity only. 8 The de\u0000cit of the Southern Energy Zone is about12 billion kWh, loading the Zhambyl State District Power Plant to 80% capacity can reduce the de\u0000cit by 6 billion kWh.ELECTRICITYMW 216 Kazakhstan ranks ninth in the world in terms of territory, so the electricity transmission over long electricity networks is characterized by relatively high losses. The power grid infrastruc- ture of the national operator of the main electric networks KEGOC consists of the networks with a voltage of 500 - 220 kV with a total length of more than 26 thousand km and networks of regional power grid companies with a voltage of 220 - 10/6 kV with a total length of more than 250 thousand km. This long- distance of the power grid contributes to high (>8%) losses of electricity during transmission. The electric power industry in Kazakhstan also includes the production and transportation of heat energy. The sources of heat energy supply are 37 CHPs, 63 large and 2,200 small boiler houses, with thermal power plants meeting about 60% of centralised heat energy supply. The heat energy is transported via heating networks (main and district) with a total length of more than 12 thousand km. The industry is characterised by high losses during the transportation of the heat energy, which can reach 30% (17% as per the oﬃcial statistics), low eﬃciency of heat energy sources and a high degree of wear and tear of the main equipment. On average, country-wide wear and tear of the heating networks is more than 60%, while the wear and tear of privately owned heating networks is more than 77%, which are caused by signi\u0000cant tariﬀ restrictions.8.2.1 Power generation According to the System Operator (KEGOC JSC), electricity production in Kazakhstan in 2022 amounted to 112.9 billion kWh, which is 1.3% less than in 2021. Notably, the Northern Energy zone accounts for the decrease in power production (3.9 billion kWh). The structure of electricity production in Kazakhstan is dominated by coal-\u0000red generation, which accounts for 68.2% of the total electricity production in the country. Ga s-\u0000red power plants produce 20.1% of electricity, hydroelectric power plants produce 8.1%, and wind and solar power plants account for 2.1% and 1.6% of electricity production, respectively, see Figure 8.3. Since 2014, total electricity production has increased by 20% (18.9 billion kWh), while the share of coal-\u0000red generation has decreased from 72.9% to 68.2% due to the development of renewable energy sources and ga s-\u0000red generation. Notably, in 1990 the share of coal-\u0000red generation was more than 80%. At the same time, the industry accounts for more than 60% of electricity consumption in Kazakhstan. The operation of thermal power plants includes consumption of electricity for the plants'"}

ELECTRICITY 217 at 5-6%, for CHPs, that also supply heat energy, the electricity consumption for own needs is about 11-17%. Updating equipment and optimising operation help reduce electricity consumption for plants' own needs. As part of their investment commitments Kazakhstan's thermal power plants constantly update \u0000xed assets, but mainly turbine equipment, see Figure 8.4. Thus, the total thermal power plants' turbine capacity installed after 1991 is 9.1 GW or 47% of the thermal power plants' total installed capacity . The volume of investment into modernisation through the capacity market mechanism is still signi\u0000cantly less compared to the annual investment into industry during 2009–2015. The renewal of CHP's \u0000xed assets is not carried out to the full extent, especially when it comes to the auxiliary equipment. A high share of the thermal power plants' wear and tear is attributed to the auxiliary equipment. The capacity tariﬀ does not cover modernisation of auxiliary equipment, it is prohibited to include auxiliary equipment into modernisation programs covered by the capacity payment. The accident with the collapse of a chimney at Petrovavlovsk CHP-2 in 2022 occurred precisely because of the lack of major repairs of the pipe belts. Notably, there is no uniform methodology for calculating the capacity tariﬀ for the power plants' modernisation programs, and tariﬀs are calculated diﬀerently subject to projects, which does not warrant the return on investment. In accordance with the requirements of an environmental legislation, apart from modernisation, coal-\u0000red power plants are required to shift to the best available technologies (BAT) with the introduction of relevant systems for reducing emissions of dust, nitrogen oxides and sulfur, and, starting from the next year, to establish a \u0000nancial fund to eliminate the consequences of their operation after decommissioning. Another direction for the evolution of coal-\u0000red generation is the integration of highly eﬃcient generation with the eﬃciency exceeding 41%. The power units with the ultra-supercritical steam parameters (USCP), pressure above 30 Mpa, and temperatures of 600 °C and higher have been actively introduced over the past 10 years in a number of countries around the world, but primarily in China. The eﬃciency of such power units reaches Figure 8.3 Structure of electricity production 2014– 2022 bln. kWh 40,060,080,0100,0120,0 0,020,0 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 202245%. As a result, the technical re-equipment of coal-\u0000red power plants with the power units with the ultra-supercritical steam parameters, the per unit fuel costs will reduce by 15-20%. The eﬃciency of coal-\u0000red power plants' units in Kazakhstan does not exceed 35%, while some power units operate with a lower eﬃciency due to resource depletion. The planned construction of coal-\u0000red units at Ekibastuz GRES-2 and Ekibastuz GRES-3 in Kazakhstan must be accompanied by the planned decommission- ing of obsolete and depleted units at Ekibastuz GRES-1. An assessment of r eplacing one 500 MW coal-\u0000red unit with a new unit with the eﬃciency of 42% with the comparable power generation (at 80% capacity factor) will lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 560 thousand tons of CО₂. Another important issue for the energy sector in Kazakhstan is the future of the large power plant in the Western energy zone - MAEK (Mangistau Nuclear Energy Plant). Since its launch in 1968, MAEK's objective has been to supply regional industry and population with electricity, heat energy, and desalinated water. Until 1999, MAEK operated the BN-350 nuclear reactor, used to produce electricity and desalinate salt water. After the nuclear reactor has been shut down gas has been used for desalination purposes. MAEK's installed capacity is 1,330 MW, the wear and tear of MAEK's turbine equipment exceeds 86%, and by 2025 the plan is to decommission 205 MW (CHP-1 - 25 MW and CHP-2 - 180 MW). MAEK's electricity production is characterized by an extremely intensive use of gas for the production of power and low capacity factor (for comparison, the CCGT units' gas consumption is approximately twice as lower). Given the planned retirement of MAEK's capacity in 2026–2027 it would be worth considering a project for the construction of combined cycle gas units with the capacity of 250 MW. Following this, we recommend to replace MAEK's retired capacity gradually with the combined cycle gas units. MAEK's site has suﬃcient space for the construction, the availability of electricity and gas infrastructure, and the grid connection is designed for the output of 1,300 MW. Given extremely intensive levels of gas consump- tion for the power production at MAEK the shift to the highly eﬃcient CCGTs will facilitate reduction in gas use when compared to the current levels.ELECTRICITY TPP coal TPP (steam turbine) gas GTPP Hydro Wind Solar Bio-gas 218 Figure 8.4 Turbine launches, MW 2656,02469,04770,0 157302322,74042,5 2000250030003500400045005000 181,5,0 050010001500 1951-1960 1961-1970 1971-1980 1981-1990 1991-2000 2001-2010 2011-2020 8.2.2 Electricity transmission and distribution The national electricity grid (NEG) infrastructure with a voltage of 500 - 220 kV is a backbone for the electricity connections between the country's regions and the energy systems of the neighboring countries. KEGOC is the operator of the NEG. Domestically, in the regions the electricity is distributed via the networks of 196 energy distribution companies (abbreviated in Russian as EPO), including 19 regional electricity grid companies (REC), and 301 energy supply companies (abbreviated in Russian as ESO) that supply electricity to the retail consumers. EPOs could be companies that use their own industrial networks to supply energy to consumers, for example, KazTransOil JSC and NC Kazakhstan T emir Zholy JSC (KTZh). The national electricity grid ensures the electricity transmission from the power producers (who have a grid connection for the power output to NEG) to the wholesale consumers (electricity distribution companies, large consumers) connected to this grid. KEGOC provides services for the use of the NEG. The total volume of electricity transmission in 2022 through KEGOC networks amounted to 58.6 billion kWh, while REC networks distributed 43.3 billion kWh; the total volume of electricity losses amounted"}

Table 8.1. When it comes to RECs' electricity grid infrastructure the main issues are high losses of electricity and depreciation of \u0000xed assets. In 2022 electricity losses during transmission via KEGOC networks amounted to 2807.7 million kWh (4.9%), while losses in RECs' networks were 4739.5 (10.9%), see Figure 8.5. At the same time, the degree of wear and tear of electrical grid equipment in RECs' networks remains high (on average above 65%) despite the fact that, according to companies, annual investments amount to about 30% of income. RECs' tariﬀ policy is a limiting factor when it comes to invest- ments; the shift to the incentive tariﬀ regulation speci\u0000ed in Kazakhstan's legislation has not taken place by the majority of RECs and the cost-based methodology is still widely used. The transition to the incentive tariﬀ in the current version of the legislation is not bene\u0000cial for REC's owners, since the calculation of tariﬀs becomes more complicated, additional obligations are introduced to achieve target indicators, and all pr o\u0000ts must be directed towards investments in full. The international experience has demonstrated that besides increased eﬃciencies and quality of operations the transition to incentive tariﬀ regulation has created conditions for the companies to reduce their impact on the environment, owing to the incentives for the integration of distributed energy sources (including RES) and demand response. At the same time, given high depreciation of the power grid assets, the network companies simultaneously have been able to address the issues with updating the \u0000xed assets and attracting investment into new assets and technologies, whilst maintaining the end consumer tariﬀs within the range established by regulators. As part of the incentive tariﬀ, in addition to modernization goals, additional targets relating to environmental impact and energy eﬃciency can also be set in Kazakhstan. However when it comes to setting tariﬀs within the incentive methodology framework it is important to guarantee a minimum rate of return for the network companies, which will help encourage regional energy companies to switch to incentive tariﬀs and accelerate the modernisation of the power grid infrastructure. Digitalisation of the power networks and infrastructure is a promising pathway for reducing losses, optimising operational modes and improving the reliability of energy supply. According to KEGOC the company has already embarked on “Automating the Uni\u0000ed Energy System of Kazakhstan Management”, that focuses on three areas: the automated frequency and capacity control (abbreviated in Russian as ARChM); the centralised automatic emergency response system (abbreviated in Russian as CSPA); the synchrophasor WAMS/WACS technologists. Within the scope of Western Energy zone uni\u0000cation with UES Kazakhstan KEGOC has embarked on a feasibility study for the construction of a 500 kV North-West AC line, most likely Atyrau- Aktobe route, with a length of 500 km. The project 's completion is estimated by 2030. 9 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/MEMO_11_125.ELECTRICITY 219 Voltage 1150 (in 500 kV mode) 500 kV 330 kV 220 kV 110 kV 35 kV 10 kV 6-0.4 kV KEGOC 1421.2 8288 1864.1 14890 352.8 44.1 110.2 13.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 1428.2 22857 .2 27082 .2 51315 .9 47613 .1 REC length, km Table 8.1 Length of KEGOC's and some of RECs network infrastructure. Overall, the construction of new power transmission lines, the goals of reducing the wear and tear of the power grid infrastruc- ture, and the challenge of digitalisation (for losses reduction amongst other things) will require increased levels of investment and a tighter control over the eﬃciency of spending. In this regard, the industry reform with the subsequent transition to the incentive methods of tariﬀ setting (warranting pr o\u0000tability and return on investment for the companies in this sector) must be accompanied by an increased independent control over the eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness of spending. 8.2.3 Electricity consumption The power consumption in Kazakhstan exceeded 1990 levels only in 2018, see picture 8.6. Notably, during the soviet era, a substantial share of power supply originated from Russia and Central Asian countries, whereas at present Kazakhstan meets almost all of its power needs with its own generation.According to the System Operator, Kazakhstan's electricity consumption in 2022 amounted to 112.9 billion kWh, which is 0.8% lower than in 2021. Between 2014 - 2022 the largest increase in electricity consump- tion was registered in the Northern Energy zone and amounted to 9.53 billion kWh, whilst in the South Energy zone the increase was 3.43 billion kWh, and in the Western Energy zone it was 2.59 billion kWh, see Table 8.2. Notably, industry accounts for the largest share (57.9%) in the structure of electricity consumption with housing and communal services (abbreviated in Russian as ZhKH from zhilicshno- kommunalnoye hozyaistvo) accounting for 22.3%, see Figure 8.8. Aksu Ferroalloy Plant is one of the largest producers and suppliers of ferroalloys in the world and is the largest consumer of electricity in Kazakhstan accounting for about 4.6% of the country's total electricity consumption.

The growth in electricity consumption in Southern Kazakhstan (Almaty and Turkestan regions) is mostly associated with the growth of region's population; particularly in Almaty and the Almaty region. At the moment, the power consumption in Kazakhstan largely depends on the pace of industrial growth and the situation at the global commodity markets, since the"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_NationalReport23_en_146", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\NationalReport23_en.pdf", "text": "main exported products are raw materials and semi- \u0000nished products, namely oil and petroleum products, natural gas, metal ores, and alloys. At the same time, Kazakhstan's electricity consumption could \u0000nd support from the emergence of new industries and consumption formats. For example, in 2021, Kazakhstan ranked third in the world after China and the United States in cryptocurrency mining with a total share of 8.2%, ¹⁰ which continued growing thereafter. In 2023, according to the Kazakhstan Blockchain T echnology Association, the country's share in global mining fell from 18.3% to 6%, as a result of increased control and disconnections of illegally connected mining farms. Notably, the cryptocurrency mining in most countries is a shadowy area and it is very diﬃcult to determine the volume of electricity consumption by this industry. Kazakhstan's policy on digital \u0000nancial assets and currencies has been de\u0000ned in a new law “On Digital Assets”. ¹¹ From 1 January 2022 the government of Kazakhstan has introduced a special tax on cryptocurrency mining. ¹² Moreover, separate tenders for the power supply to the miners are held by the Single Electricity Buyer. Sanctions against Russia resulting from the military con\u0000ict in Ukraine have resulted in the decision of a number of Russian companies to relocate their production sites to Kazakhstan. This important factor should be accounted for when forecasting the power demand. An uneven distribution of generating capacity by Energy zones, the issues with the North-South transit congestion, and the unevenness of consumption growth by energy systems bring to the forefront the importance of eﬃcient energy system planning. The challenges associated with demand forecasting also include changes to the duration and nature of peak power consumption as a result of temperature and anomalies variations, duration and frequency caused by climate change. 8.2.4 Industry regulation Based on the recommendations from The National Energy Report 2021 Kazakhstan has introduced the Single Electricity Buyer model, which was a signi\u0000cant change in the design of its electricity market. Other recommendations for electricity regulation have not been implemented yet. The eﬀectiveness of the mechanisms for regulating the industry by the state is critically important for the development of the electric power industry. With this regard the key proposals of how to reform the power sector are listed in section 9.3 of this report. . The key govern- ment bodies responsible for regulation and price-setting policy in Kazakhstan's electricity industry are: The Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan The operation of the electric power industry in Kazakhstan is governed by the norms of the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On the Electric Power Industry”, the Law “On Natural Monopolies”, and the Law “On Support of Renewable Energy Sources”. The laws de\u0000ne the principles of the electric power sector and the renewables sector operation, approaches to Figure 8.6 Electricity consumption and peak load in 1990-2022 681012141618 40,060,080,0100,0120,0 th.

In accordance with the Law “On the Electricity Industry”, the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan develops the main direction for state policy in the electric power industry. The Ministry of Energy According to the legislation, the Ministry of Energy (with more than 80 scopes of duties) is charged with the implementation of state policy in the electric power industry as set out in the Law “On the Electric Power Industry”.When it comes to price and tariﬀ regulation in the electric power industry, the Ministry of Energy is responsible for setting the power price caps for electric power, the price caps for balancing, and the price caps for capacity. In addition, the Ministry of Energy sets individual capacity tariﬀs for existing and newly commis- sioned power plants. The Committee for the Regulation of Natural Monopolies (CREM) of the Ministry of National Economy The Committee performs the state regulation and control of natural monopolies. The Committee sets tariﬀs for the services of natural monopolies:ELECTRICITY 222 ► transmission and/or distribution of electricity; ► production, transmission,"}

Renewables policy support in Kazakhstan Wind and solar power plants, which form the basis of renewable energy capacity, require government support due to their relatively high cost of electricity and the unstable nature of generation. Industrial and other consumers require a reliable source of energy supply rather than weather-dependent intermittent generation. Therefore, both in Kazakhstan and throughout the world, renewable energy sources are being integrated into the energy system upon receiving various types of support. The hidden costs associated with renewable energy sources are the costs of their integration into energy systems. Since 2014, Kazakhstan has been constantly improving legislation supporting renewable energy sources. As a result, the following RES support mechanisms are currently in eﬀect: ► a single buyer of renewable energy (RFC for RES) purchases the entire volume of renewable output; ► the purchase of the entire volume of renewable output at auction prices is warranted for 20 years under an agreement with RFC RES; ► RES tariﬀs are indexed annually, and adjusted to the currency exchange rate in the event of devaluation of the national currency; ► for the auction winners, starting from 2022, tariﬀs are indexed during the construction of renewable energy sources from the moment the agreement with RFC RES is signed; ► RES producers are exempt from paying for transmission services; ► there is priority RES connection to the electricity networks; ► RES get land reservations during auctions, subject to grid infrastructure; ► RES developers enjoy tax preferences provided for them by the law This level of government support creates high level of stability for investors, which in turn made it possible to introduce renewable energy capacity in such a short period of time. However, the calculation of the auction price might be insuﬃcient to attract investors to auctions. In addition, more information is required about Kazakhstan's hydro potential and reservation of sites large hydropower plants. For new hydropower projects, the issue of reserving and allocating land plots is the most problem- atic. 8.2.5 Electricity market and Single Electricity Buyer The Republic of Kazakhstan was the \u0000rst of the post-Soviet countries to launch a free competitive electric power market in 2004 with the adoption of the Law “On the Electric Power Industry”.The wholesale electricity and capacity market includes: ► decentralized market (market of bilateral agreements); ► centralized market (day ahead and intra-day trading); ► system services and auxiliary services market; ► balancing market (until 1 July 2023 it operated in a simulation mode); ► capacity market, launched on 1 January 1 2019 to facilitate return on investments into modernisation and re-building of existing power plants and construction of new conventional generation. The wholesale power market liberalisation as it had been envisaged in the Law “On the Electric Power Industry” has not been fully completed, and the market has operated on the basis of bilateral agreements between wholesale consumers and generating companies trading power at free prices (later at capped power tariﬀs). The Government of Kazakhstan has created a regulatory, technical, and organisational structure for the operation of a centralized power market, including the spot market for day ahead and intra-day trading. However, despite the noticeable progress during the initial stage of the power sector reform any further progress stalled. When it comes to the structure of the power market, the number and aﬃliation of its participants Kazakhstan's market represents an oligopoly. ¹³ Under such a model, the limited number of producers prevents the market mechanisms from being eﬀective and suﬃcient for the competitive regulation of electricity prices, whilst the limited number of buyers at the electricity market, some of whom are aﬃliated with the power producers (RECs, ESOs), do not put suﬃcient competitive downward pressure on the electricity price. On the other hand, the power plants have diﬀerent net costs and cost structures limiting the eﬀectiveness of market mechanisms. . Since 2009, Kazakhstan has been unable to \u0000nd the necessary balance between market liberalisation and the resources intended for modernization and expansion and required for the energy companies (generation and electric networks). In addition, the excess generating capacity that used to be in the energy system in the past obscured the urgency and need for a serious long-term power industry development forecasting. The signi\u0000cant surplus generating capacity that the country inherited after gaining its independence and the during the decline in economic activity has been exhausted as the country's economy grew. The energy system has already faced electricity shortages in 2007-2012. The “Tariﬀ – for- investment” scheme that introduced marginal tariﬀs for electrical energy has become the answer to the issues then. As a result, the emerging de\u0000cit has been eliminated and a medium-term power reserve has been created by launching 1.2 GW of new capacities and restoring 1.7 GW of existing ones. At present, Kazakhstan faces a challenge of attracting investments into large infrastructural projects that envisage the expansion and modernisation of generating assets and the power grid. T o attract signi\u0000cant investments into the power industry it would be necessary to develop a long-term tariﬀ policy that would enable to balance the interests of the state, consumers, and energy companies.ELECTRICITY 223 28,3% 4,1%3,9%16,5% 6,6% 6,3% 24,6%9,7%Samruk-Energo CAEPCO KUS Power plants owned by industry State owned power plants Oil and gas power plants RES via RFC Other power plantsFigure 8.8 Structure of electricity production by plant owners. 13 Oligopoly refers to a type of imperfectly competitive market structure in which an extremely small number of product suppliers/sellers predominate.The \u0000rst signi\u0000cant step in establishing a new market structure that would enable to resolve these complex issues has been the transition from a competitive power market model to the model of a Single Electricity Buyer from 1 July 2023.

At that, all consumers could not get access to “cheap” power due to limited supply and the sale of power at cheap prices under free bilateral agreements on terms dictated to by the energy producing companies. Notably, almost the entire wholesale market volume (more than 99% since 2020) has been sold under bilateral agree- ments; ► non-transparency of power sales and supply; ► Illiquid centralized electricity market; lack of power price volatility due to state price regulation and capped tariﬀs for generation. Financial Settlement Centre for the support of renewable sources of energy (RFC for RES), an organization subordinate to the Ministry of Energy, has been appointed a Single Electricity Buyer. When purchasing electricity, the Single Electricity Buyer: ► purchases planned RES output in full (those that have signed an agreement with RFC for RES); ► purchases planned capacity from the power plants that have entered into long-term capacity contracts with the Single Electricity Buyer in full; ► purchases planned electricity output from the energy producing companies that comprise of CHPs, in full;► purchases the remainder of the electric power from the energy producing companies regardless of their type (GRES, HPP, etc.) based on the results of a centralised trade on a competitive basis; ► if necessary, imports electricity and capacity. The Single Electricity Buyer sells: ► electricity at \u0000xed prices to the consumers with the targeted support; ► electricity at renewable tariﬀs to the industrial groups (“conditional” consumers); ► electricity to the digital mining companies following the rules of upward price bidding; ► electricity at settlement daily price to all other market consumers. It is premature to draw conclusions about the success of a new Single Buyer model, due to the very short time of its operation at a time of publication. However, the mechanism of a Single Electricity Buyer may turn out to be more eﬀective when compared with the earlier model in the context of anticipated growth of generating capacity, need for a competitive selection of electricity suppliers, the requirement to guarantee returns on investment for the new power projects, as well as the possibility of using internal reserves for balancing. The risks and issues of a Single Buyer model are: 1) The immaturity of regulatory framework at launch of a Single Electricity Buyer model creates diﬃculties for the wholesale electricity and capacity market participants. In particular, the standard agreement between the Single Buyer and condi- tional consumers (industrial groups) has not been approved yet; 2) The legal acts have not clearly de\u0000ned or attributed the areas of responsibility to the following infrastructural organisations: RFC for RES, KOREM, KEGOC, which also creates diﬃculties for the market entities when it comes to disputes; 3) The decision to introduce a single power tariﬀ for all consumers has been postponed inde \u0000nitely, including consumers with targeted support that purchase electricity at prices lower than the Single Buyer's settlement price. On the one hand, this would help prevent a sharp increase in electricity tariﬀs, including those for the residential ELECTRICITY 224 Figure 8.9 The thermal power plants' costs structure. 20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% 0%10%20% Zhambyl GRES TETS-1 Astana TETS-2 Astana Balhakh TETS Zhezkazgan TETS Karaganda GRES Karaganda GRES-1 Stepnogorsk TETS Kentau TETS-5 T ekeli TETS-2 Urals TETS Kostanai TETS Almaty TETS TETS-1 MAEK TETS-2 MAEK AZF Kazkhrom power plant Shymkent TETS-3 consumers; on the other hand, this could result in price subsidies of some consumers at the expense of the others, which would subsequently lead to consumer discontent; 4) The most signi\u0000cant risks of a Single Buyer model are associated with potentially poor payment discipline and possible cash gaps. This is due to the fact that some of the wholesale electricity market participants, namely ESO GP (suppliers of last resort), do not make advance payments for electricity (the share of such consumers in the market is about 30%). For the energy producing organisations (power plants), this means that they will receive full payments for the produced electricity (provided that all consumers meet their \u0000nancial obligations) within 45 days after the cut-oﬀ date of the current billing period (a calendar month). Therefore, it is unclear how the energy producing organisations are expected to fund their business activity during these periods, including purchasing fuel in advance and making the required repairs, etc. Moreover, the legislation on the electric power industry does not envisage a working mechanism to support the Single Buyer if it defaults on its commitments towards energy-producing organisations. Since the sustainable performance of an entire electric power industry depends on the \u0000nancial health of a Single Buyer and its ability to make timely payments to the wholesale market participants, it is important to consider setting a fund supporting the Single Buyer. With this regard, one can study the experience of setting and operating a reserve Single Buyer fund insuring against non-payment to the renewable producers. The operation of a Single Buyer model in the context of administrative price regulation for generation should be largely aimed at addressing the energy system task of achieving an optimal load and committing the most cost-eﬀective units. It would be possible introduce multi-criteria optimisation methods of unit commitment based on many input parameters, such as greenhouse gas emissions reduction, minimisation of fuel consumption for the production of 1 kWh of electricity, minimisation of the \u0000nal cost of electricity for the energy system as a whole, etc., rather than a single price-based unit commitment. As a result, the transition to the mechanism of a Single Electricity Buyer could make it possible to create a fundamentally new alternative to the free market and a more eﬃcient energy system built on mathematical principles and information technology in the future. Alongside the Single Electricity Buyer Kazakhstan launched its"}

However, there is not enough data to analyze its eﬀectiveness due to limited time since its launch. 8.2.6 Approaches to return on invest- ment in modernizing power plants Since 2009, Kazakhstan applied price caps to the price of electric power. The introduction of price caps for power generating companies has been an attempt to resolve the challenge of generating capacity inadequacy by modernising the country's generating assets in the shortest possible time. In exchange for receiving a higher price cap each power plant committed to a 2009–15 investment plan. Maximum tariﬀs were subject to annual adjustment, taking into account the need to ensure the invest- ment attractiveness of the industry. The price caps were subject to annual upward adjustments so to maintain the investment attractiveness for the industry. In 2009–15, under this “tariﬀ-for- investment” price-cap scheme, the power sector attracted about USD 6.8 billion into expansion, modernisation, and overhaul of existing power plants. The “tariﬀ-for-investment” scheme was successfully completed at the end of 2015 adding about 3,000 MW of generating capacity to the energy system . The ”tariﬀ-for-investment” price-cap scheme was replaced by capacity market that was launched in Kazakhstan in 2019. Following the launch of the capacity market and subsequent changes to the wholesale market legislation, the consumers' power price changed to accommodate the two variables: the price cap for the electric power set by groups of energy producing companies (the tariﬀ for electric power) and the price for the ELECTRICITY 225 services of maintaining the capacity “ready to generate” (the capacity tariﬀ). The capacity tariﬀ for the wholesale consumers is made up of the following averaged costs: ► The cost of the newly commissioned capacity ► The cost of modernised capacity or of the capacity undergo- ing expansion ► The cost of CHPs capacity in the volume necessary to meet the heat load schedule ► The cost of capacity selected during the centralised annual trade ► The Single Buyer's costs The sum of the total costs, accounting for the Single Buyer's commission (RFC RES from raschetno- \u0000nancoviy tsenter podderzhki vozobnovlyayemykh istochnikov energii), are divided by the total amount of absolute peak consumption load for the coming year (calculated from the total amount of consumption during the peak hour). A single capacity price that derives from these calculations is set in tenge/MW/month. Notably, there is lack of transparency and market mechanisms for selecting and determining the capacity tariﬀ for modernised and expanded power plants. The terms of such projects, as well as the price for power, are established individually by the Ministry of Energy based on the recommendations of the Council of the Kazakhstan Electric Power Association, appointed by the decree of the Ministry of Energy as the Market Council. The Market Council includes representatives of energy companies only, thus the Market Council executive committee cannot be fully objective when making decisions, including those on the power plants' investment projects, that in the end of the day would be paid by the end consumers. The capacity tariﬀ for power plants undergoing modernisation excludes the costs of modernising the auxiliary equipment, which ultimately negatively aﬀects the operation of power plants and the number of emergency outages. A major accident at Petropavlovsk CHP-2 occurred precisely because of the lack of major repairs of the chimney. The launch of the capacity market was accompanied by the adoption of the Ministry of Energy's decision to reduce the capacity price cap to 590 thousand tenge/MW per month instead of the previously announced capacity tariﬀ price cap of around 700 thousand tenge/MW per month. In addition, the electricity price caps in 2019–20 excluded pr o\u0000t margins. Altogether, these decisions had a negative impact on attracting investment into Kazakhstan's generating assets. The eﬀect that the centralised capacity trade has had on the capacity price reduction is limited to 0.1%, which generally makes competitive capacity selection meaningless, see Table 8.2. The lack of capacity market vision and goal setting reduces this mechanism to the re-distribution of capacity revenue between the power plants. In February 2023, the Agency for the Protection and Development of Competition (abbreviated in Russian as AZRK) analyzed capacity trade and concluded lack of competition based on auctions' results.ELECTRICITY Figure 8.10 Single Buyer electricity trading model RES (PPA) Direct sale outside of auction Tariﬀ for support of RES Conditional consumersTrading price to increase Cryptocurrency minersFix price Consumers with targeted supportSettlement price Other consumersDirect sale outside of auctionDirect sale outside of auctionCentralized trading Purchase in case of shortagePower plants (CHP)Power plants (Power Market )Power plants (free volume )Russia (import ) 1 2 3 4 5 A single buyer buys at diﬀerent prices, then, averaging, sets a single price for consumers based on each hour of the day 226 The decision to launch the capacity market with the price constraints described above, as well as the administratively capped annual amount of funds ¹⁴ that could be used for the modernisation and overhaul of the power assets at individual tariﬀs have resulted in a signi\u0000cant reduction in the level of investments into the power plants since 2019. An alternative to the current situation in the capacity market could be an increase in the electric power price caps and competitive capacity selection, for example, with the required characteristics and technological parameters of equipment operation. Over the past decade, the power generating sector has been the testing ground for a variety of tariﬀ policies: from the free market price formation to the introduction of the “tariﬀ-in-exchange for investment” scheme, from setting the price cap without pr o\u0000t margins to the inclusion of the cost of renewable energy into the price caps, and \u0000nally singling out the allowances within the price caps that support the use of renewable energy. ¹⁵ T o ensure the progressive development of the electric power industry it is important to de\u0000ne the long-term tariﬀ policy and assign the powers relating to the setting and approval of all tariﬀs in the electric power industry to a single state body."}

Taking into account Kazakhstan's plans to develop generating capacity, including renewable generation, as well as accounting for the current lack of suﬃcient volume of \u0000exible generation the development of regional cooperation with adjacent energy systems is critical for the country's energy security. Currently, Kazakhstan's power shortages are met by Russia; power supplies from the Kyrgyz Republic in summer traditionally take place in exchange for water for the irrigation of the southern regions of Kazakhstan. Notably, when it comes to exploring the opportunities for regional cooperation and the cross-border power trade Kazakhstan is already participating in the creation of following two markets: 1) The common electricity market of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) 2) The regional electricity market of Central Asian countries (CAREM - Central Asia Regional Electricity Market). The common electricity market of the Eurasian Economic Union is being formed as a regional market of \u0000ve EAEU member states (the Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and the Russian Federation). Considering that the EAEU member states have quite diﬀerent designs of the wholesale electricity markets the parties agreed to preserve the existing national electricity markets when forming the EAEU common electricity market. It is planned that the common EAEU electricity market will be launched on January 1, 2025. The power trading between the common EAEU electricity market participants will be in a form of: 14 The National project for the development of the electric power industry Measure 1. Increasing the limit on the permissible volume of attracting investments within the framework of investment agreements of energy producing organizations for the modernization, expansion, reconstruction and (or) renewal of power plants within the framework of the electric capacity market from the level of investment in the electric power industry in 2015. 15 The transition to a Single Purchaser of Electricity eliminated the need to introduce surcharges for renewable energy sources into marginal tariﬀs.

Medium-term EAEU member states energy balances' forecasts to 2030 show the Kyrgyz Republic electricity shortages (according to the Ministry of Energy of the Kyrgyz Republic, the annual electricity shortage in the country is about 3 billion kWh ).ELECTRICITY 227 When it comes to assessing the prospects for the development of this regional association, it is important to emphasize that its infrastructure (the interstate power transmission lines) which is used as a foundation for this market has not received signi\u0000cant development, which may become an obstacle to increasing the power supply along UES Russia-UES Kazakhstan – UES Central Asia (Kyrgyzstan ) route in the future The development of regional power trade amongst the Central Asian countries has its own speci\u0000cs as the countries in the region have diﬀerent primary resources to meet the energy load. Thus, the Kyrgyz Republic and the Republic of Tajikistan have signi\u0000cant water resource potential, the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Republic of Uzbekistan have both traditional resources to meet the load – coal and gas, as well as ambitious plans to increase renewable generation. The following circumstances hinder the full development potential for regional cooperation and scaling up of electricity supply between the countries: ► Currently, Kyrgyzstan's power industry is energy- de\u0000cient and it would be necessary to increase the power supply from the neighboring countries in the medium term. The government of the country believes that the energy supply problem would be resolved by building hydroelectric generation (small and large hydroelectric power stations), as well as the development of renewable energy. According to experts, the construction of large hydropower plants (for example, Kambarata HPP-1) will take approximately 10 years, subject to stable \u0000nancing; ► Tajikistan is currently a power exporter in the region and supplies electrical energy to Uzbekistan and Afghanistan from spring to autumn. The only power sector project which could signi\u0000cantly aﬀect the development of its export potential is the construction of the Rogun HPP; ► The capacity mix in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan is not balanced, the power production depends on the water regime. This presents a challenge with the power supply in the autumn- winter period; ► Tajikistan continues to operate in isolation from the Central Asian UES (the country exited the agreement on the parallel operation in 2009), which negatively aﬀects the possibilities for the power exchange. It is worth noting that work to restore the parallel operation is in its active phase. August 2023 marked the completion of the works in the southwest- ern direction. It is expected that full parallel operation will be restored in April 2024; ► The Southern Energy zone Kazakhstan's energy system is currently energy de\u0000cient and, according to the approved forecast balance, will remain de\u0000cient in the coming years. Notably, the Southern Energy zone is a leader in the development of renewable generation in the country. Given the lack of \u0000exible generation in Kazakhstan, the country is potentially interested in expanding cooperation with the neighboring countries to solve the problem of reliable energy supply to its consumers; ► Uzbekistan has"}

The country's leadership has aims at increasing RES capacity to 15 GW by 2030 and bringing their share in the total power production to more than 30 percent. At the same time, according to the data provided in the “Concept of supplying the Republic of Uzbekistan with electrical energy in 2020-2030,” the average power production growth in 2012–2019 registered 2.6 percent per year. However, the power demand has not been met fully registering 9.4 percent supply shortage. Another aspect that creates diﬃculties in ensuring a reliable power supply in Uzbekistan is the inability of the country's gas transportation system to meet the demand from the power companies at any time; ► the most diﬃcult issue in energy cooperation between the countries of the Central Asian region has traditionally been the interdependences between the water sector and the electric power complex. One of the most important and promising projects in this direction is the construction of Kambarata HPP-1 (Kyrgyz Republic). In January 2023, the heads of the energy departments of the Kyrgyz Republic, the Republic of Kazakhstan, and the Republic of Uzbekistan signed a joint roadmap for the construc- tion of Kambarata HPP-1. Summer 2023 demonstrated the importance of joint eﬀorts in implementing this project, when due to abnormally high temperatures and low water periods, agricultural crops were “lost” in the south of Kazakhstan and in some regions of Kyrgyzstan. In the context of stalling of the regional dialogue on water and energy issues, the solution to the problem of functioning of the Lower Naryn hydro cascade (Kyrgyz Republic) could be the commissioning of new generating capacities, namely Kambarata HPP-1 and HPP-2 in Kyrgyzstan. Located in the middle course of Naryn river above the T oktogul reservoir, these hydro power stations will be independent from the irrigation restrictions and would be able to operate in energy mode all year round. It is believed that this will allow the T oktogul hydroelectric complex to return to normal irrigation mode of operation and accumulate winter water for the needs of the growing season in the neighbor- ing republics. Based on the current state of the electric power industries of the adjacent energy systems one of the most promising directions for Kazakhstan's power supply could be the Kyrgyz Republic. Based on the above, there are clear prospects for the regional cooperation in the Central Asian region, moreover, the countries themselves express such interest. Based on the current state of the power industries' development in these countries, the most promising areas of cooperation in the region may be: 1) resolving the water and energy issues through the implemen- tation of joint investment power projects - the construction of new large hydro power plants capable of providing electricity and \u0000exible energy, which is a necessary requirement accounting for the plans to develop renewable energy in the region, but also ensuring water supply in the required volume for the needs of irrigation in the region; 2) strengthening the energy connections in the region is a necessary factor for increasing the volume of electricity supply between the countries. The interstate power network infrastructure needs to be modernized, and accounting for the large power generation investment projects at the regional level it is necessary to identify the projects facilitating reinforcement of the interstate power lines; 3) existing possibilities for the development of regional trade will ELECTRICITY 228 contribute to the development of market mechanisms between the countries; among the promising areas, in addition to the traditional supply of power between countries is the development of intersystem services, which might become a necessary condition for increasing the variable RES generation in the region. 8.2.8 Heat energy supply In Kazakhstan the electric power industry ¹⁶ also includes the heat energy sector, since 60% of the heat energy is produced by the power plants (CHPs). The cogeneration of electricity and heat energy by TETs in Kazakhstan falls under dual regulation by both the Ministry of Energy (that sets the price caps for the electric power) and by KREM that sets the heat energy tariﬀs. Due to the social signi\u0000cance of prices for the heat energy, the state, through KREM, curbs the tariﬀs growth by setting tariﬀs lower. At the same time when CHPs heat energy tariﬀs are capped they face the price competition from the coal-\u0000red CPPs (GRES). The electrical eﬃciency of electricity production at CPPs (GRES) is physically higher than that at CHPs, but the fuel energy utilisation ratio at CHPs is 70–80% due to the associated heat energy production. The eﬃciency of using CHPs instead of a combination of a boiler house and a CPP(GRES) has been proven scienti\u0000cally and empirically by the fact that the total resource costs at CHPs are lower for heating and power supply purposes in the northern cities with a population of more than 100 thousand people. Unlike the electric power industry the heat energy supply involves three variables: production, transportation (inclusive of the distribution and supply of heat energy) and consumption of heat energy. The heat energy market operates at the retail level only, at that, in practice consumers are unable to choose their heat energy suppliers. The heating networks and the boiler houses tend to be on the balance sheets or under management of municipal authorities. This way they are forced to make direct investments into updating the heating networks infrastructure. A separate law “On the Heat Energy Sector” has been under development for more than two years. It aims at singling out the regulation for this industry and optimizing the planning of heat loads and operating modes of the heating networks. Setting heat energy tariﬀ caps at cost or below production costs means that power plants lack resources to implement energy eﬃciency and modernization projects (unless the latter are included into investment projects through the capacity market). The seven-year tariﬀ caps should send long-term price signals to investors; instead they are constantly revised and fail to account for the in\u0000ationary growth in costs for"}

In general, these issues are common to the regulation of natural monopolies, although the heat energy tariﬀ appears to be suppressed most. It is necessary to understand that the increase in the volume of repairs and level of heating networks modernisation requires either direct government funding, as municipal budgets are insuﬃcient, or raising heat supply tariﬀs to their true values. T o oﬀset the consequences of rising heat supply tariﬀs for the residential consumers (population) it would be important to introduce a system of preferential tariﬀs. As an option, the introduction of a “social housing norm” (about 45 m2 per person) can be considered. If a household, accounting for the number of residents, falls within this norm the heat supply tariﬀ is less than the approved one, and if it exceeds, then the tariﬀ is correspond- ingly higher than the approved one. Other approaches to diﬀerentiation of heat supply tariﬀs are also possible. 8.2.9 Workforce policy One of the systemic problems that negatively aﬀects the state of the industry is the lack of quali\u0000ed workforce. The reasons for this situation in the industry are both the retirement of existing professionals and insuﬃcient intake of new workforce wishing to become professional power sector employees. According to the oﬃcial data, the staﬀ turnover rate in the 2nd quarter of 2023 in the power supply sector was 8.5%. In comparison, the same \u0000gure for the related sector Mining and Quarrying is 5.2%. For a long time, one of the main reasons for staﬀ turnover was low wages, which contributed to the out \u0000ow of specialists to other industries. However, the draft law “On introducing amendments and additions to some legislative acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the implementation of certain instructions of the Head of State”, made changes to Article 22 of the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Natural Monopolies” in 2022. In particular, paragraph 1) was supplemented by subparagraph 9-1) with the following content: «9-2) changes to the average monthly salary by type of economic activity, formed, according to the statistics, for the year in the region (region, city of republican signicance, capital), in which the subject of a natural monopoly provides regulated services provided for in subparagraphs 3), 4) and 14) paragraph 1 of article 5 of this Law;».Table 8.4 Number of employees by age in the industry.

At the same time, the in\u0000ux of new workforce is limited as the poor \u0000nancial prospects deter young specialists from choosing the energy sector as a \u0000eld of study, or, after graduating, they work outside their specialty. See below statistics ¹⁷ for 2022 on the people employed in the electricity and gas supply, and air conditioning , by age: Notably, about 70% of industry workers are aged 35 years and older, despite the fact that the average age in the sector is 41-42 years. One of the possible solutions is to increase the number of educational grants in the energy industry by 30%, as well as the introduce requirements for personnel optimization under incentive tariﬀ regulation, and simultaneous introduction of special rates applicable to the growth of employees' salaries. Salaries in the electric power industry should be one and a half to two times higher than the average salaries in the corresponding region or city. 8.3 Industr y reform and energy transition Since 2014, renewable energy has been at the core of Kazakhstan's \"energy transition\" with a reduction in the share of coal generation, however the focus on the development of wind and solar power plants over time have lead to the imbalances and an increase in the need to balance the operation of unstable energy sources by the Russian energy system. T o ensure energy security capacity adequacy and availability of reserves to cover the load as well as to self-balance the energy system would be essential. In 2022 Kazakshtan announced plans for the construction of two power units at Ekibastuz GRES-2 and the construction of a new power plant at Ekibastuz GRES-3. In 2023, President K. T okayev proposed to hold a national referendum on the construction of a nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan. If the referendum takes place and the people of Kazakhstan decide to commission nuclear generation in Kazakhstan, there is a possibility to commission two nuclear units with a total capacity of up to 2800 MW. The plans for the construction of the second line of Beineu- Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline and the construction of a number of \u0000exible gas energy sources in the south of the country ¹⁸ are the \u0000rst stage of the energy system ga si\u0000cation. The international stance on Russia and the EU sanctions against it means Russia is gradually re-routing natural gas transportation from Europe to the Asia-P aci\u0000c region. One of the consequences of this re-routing could be the construction of a gas pipeline from Russia to eastern Kazakhstan with the subsequent ga si\u0000cation of coal-\u0000red boiler houses and CHPs, for example the gas pipeline project “Barnaul – Rubtsovsk – Semey – Ust-Kamenogorsk with a branch to Pavlodar”. In reality, the main focus of the power sector transformation is already shifting from the intermittent energy sources (wind and solar power plants) to ga si\u0000cation of coal power plants and boiler houses and the construction of nuclear power plants, as well as the replacement of coal power units with new coal technologies. T o implement new energy projects and modernise the industry, it is necessary to reform the industry. Proposals for the industry"}

Single Electricity Buyer: ► gradual automation and digitalization of the Single Electricity Buyer operations with the introduction of the principles of multi-criteria optimization during unit commitment; ► Single out and distribute areas of responsibility between the infrastructure organizations - RFC for RES LLP, KOREM JSC, KEGOC JSC at a legislative level ; ► create the Single Electricity Buyer Reserve Stabilization Fund as soon as possible to solve the issues with late payments and cash gaps.ELECTRICITY 17 https://stat.gov.kz/oﬃcial/industry/25/statistic/5 . 18 CCGT Turkestan, CCGT Kyzylorda, CCGT based on the Almaty Thermal Power Plant and the project currently being considered for the construction of a CCGT plant in Shymkent. 230 Regulation of natural monopolies T o encourage natural monopoly entities to switch to incentive tariﬀ setting, it is necessary to include the following requirements: ► natural monopolies should have the right to retain up to 50% of the pr o\u0000t and use it at their own discretion, while the rest of the pr o\u0000t should be used for ROI purposes; ► pro\u0000t, following RAB regulation, should be calculated as a product of WACC and the assets base, at that costs of equipment repairs can be partially included in the assets base. ► a uniform minimum WACC rate should be set for all subjects; ► if a natural monopoly fails to achieve the approved target indicators \u0000nes are imposed on the entities' own pr o\u0000t, right down to reducing it zero; ► the tariﬀ is approved once every 5 years and is not revised downward, therefore, the cost savings are retained by the entity; ► the ability to interchange cost items. T o ensure the eﬀectiveness of the transition to the incentive tariﬀ it is necessary to strengthen control over natural monopolies and conduct independent audits of the eﬃciency of costs and investments, as well as operating activities. For KREM to get \u0000nancing of this activity a special tariﬀ surcharge applicable to all subjects that fall under natural monopolies regulation could be introduced. An absolute requirement in the implementation of the above reforms and plans for the development of the electric power industry would be the increase in electricity and heat energy tariﬀs. T o smooth out social factors and the consequences of rising tariﬀs we recommend to use and combine several approaches: ► direct partial payment of electricity and heat energy bills for the most socially vulnerable segments of the population, subject to compliance with energy consumption standards; ► large (more than 3 levels) diﬀerentiation of tariﬀs according to consumption norms which will also incentivise energy saving; ► increased share of costs cross-subsidization for population at the expense of other groups of consumers, primarily state budget funded organizations. When planning measures to oﬀset costs associated with rising electricity and heat energy tariﬀs for the vulnerable groups of population we recommend avoiding direct monetization of bene\u0000ts. Monetization of bene\u0000ts has the following disadvantages: ► diﬃculty with estimating the suﬃcient amount of compensation for bene\u0000ts; ► social discontent by the social strata of the population that are not cla ssi\u0000ed as vulnerable but are “borderline” and could feel the impact of rising tariﬀs signi\u0000cantly; ► lack of guarantees that allocated funds would be directed to their intended purposes; ► rising in\u0000ation. The \u0000rst step in reforming tariﬀ-setting should be the resolution of social issues and the development of combined approaches to minimise the impact of rising tariﬀs for socially vulnerable segments of the population.ELECTRICITY Figure 8.11 The structure of electricity generation by power plants in Kazakhstan in 2025–2050.bln. kWhTPP coal TPP gas Biofuel Hydro Hydro, small scale Nuclear Solar Wind 60,080,0100,0120,0140,0160,0 0,020,040,0 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050 231 8.4 Electric power industry development forecasts The forecast for the development of the electric power industry in Kazakhstan calculated in the previous publication of this report (NED 2021) remains generally relevant. The TIMES electricity forecast was developed as part of the IEA- ETSAP methodology for energy scenarios for an in-depth energy and environmental analysis (Loulou et al., 2004). The forecast made in 2021 assumed a balanced development of generation for the long term, both renewable sources and gas and nuclear generation. The forecast in this report has been adjusted to account for the time it would take to build nuclear power plants and the plans for commissioning coal-\u0000red capacity. It is important to note that the development of coal-\u0000red generation through the replacement of outdated power units with modern power units with ultra-supercritical steam parameters (USCP) will reduce speci\u0000c fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 15-20%. As a result, in the long term until 2050, we recommend the following balanced approach to the development of power generation in Kazakhstan,: ► replacement of coal power plants with modern coal power units with USCP; ► gradual conversion of coal-\u0000red boiler houses and CHPs to natural gas; ► construction of several nuclear power plants with a total capacity of at least 4 GW; ► development of renewable"}

This forecast is aligned with the low-carbon development goals outlined in Kazakhstan's Carbon neutrality Strategy to 2060. 232 NUCLEAR ENERGY AND URANIUM INDUSTRY 9. NUCLEAR ENERGY AND URANIUM INDUSTRY 9.1 Key points ► Since the early 2000s, Kazakhstan has increased uranium production twelvefold. Kazakhstan's second place in the world in terms of uranium reserves, availability of technology and eﬀective management of the national company allowed it to attract signi\u0000cant foreign investment in the industry and ensure the \u0000rst place in the world in uranium mining. ► Kazakhstan currently accounts for about 42% of global uranium production, although it is important to note the overall decline in global uranium production (by 17% over 10 years). Uranium production has also decreased in key mining countries: in Australia by 28% and in Canada by 21%. The decrease in uranium production is compensated for by uranium reserves and the use of accumulated stocks of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium. ► Uranium prices show stable growth. Thus, in September 2023, the spot market price reached US$70 per pound of uranium. The growth of uranium prices is related both to geopolitical unrest against the backdrop of the coup in Niger and the military operation of the Russian Federation, and to the long- term trend towards the expansion of nuclear energy generation capacity in the world. ► According to our estimates, the implementation of plans to build nuclear power plants in the world will lead to a 1.5-fold increase in uranium consumption by 2035, and according to the World Nuclear Association, uranium demand will double by 2040. However, it is uranium that presents an important challenge that is diﬃcult to comprehend in the current market environment - the \u0000niteness of the resource. Despite the fact that Kazakhstan ranks second in the world in terms of uranium reserves, at the current level of production the reserves will be practically exhausted in 25-30 years. Rising demand and uranium prices are stimulating the growth of uranium production in Kazakhstan, where it is technologically easier to increase production, but this makes the problem of depleting uranium reserves even more urgent. In 2022, due to rising uranium prices, the net pr o\u0000t of the national nuclear company NAC Kazatomprom JSC doubled. In our view, it is strategically important to allocate a signi\u0000cant portion of the national company's pr o\u0000ts to increase exploration and address long-term planning issues, taking into account the possible transformation of the nuclear fuel cycle. ► As uranium reserves are exhausted and the price rises even more, the nuclear fuel cycle will most likely start to be restruc- tured through more plutonium-fueled fast reactors and the use of thorium. ► 2022, the \u0000rst batch of fuel assemblies (FA) was shipped and accepted by a nuclear power plant in China. The production of the \u0000nal components of nuclear fuel is a complex high-tech production process and the construction of a fuel assembly production plant in Kazakhstan is a signi\u0000cant achievement. The commissioned fuel assembly production capacity allows to increase the production load of Ulba Metallurgical Plant for nuclear pellets, the production of which has increased more than eightfold since 2016.► In 2023, an important political event took place - the President of Kazakhstan K. T okayev proposed to put the issue of NPP construction to a referendum. If the referendum results are positive, nuclear power could become an important element of the transition to a \"green\" economy. 9.2 Uranium production and reserves NAC Kazatomprom JSC, a national uranium mining company and operator of uranium and nuclear fuel exports, operates 26 uranium deposits through its subsidiaries and joint ventures. A common feature of all Kazakhstani uranium deposits is that they are mined from sedimentary (sandstone) deposits using in-situ leaching (ISL). This technology was developed independently in the USSR and the USA in the mid-1970s. The ISL technology is a more cost-eﬀective and less environmentally harmful method of uranium mining compared to traditional (mine) methods. Uranium mining using the ISL method involves injecting leachate (1-2% sulfuric acid (H ₂SO₄) solution) into the permeable ore body through a system of injection wells. Drilling is currently carried out to depths of no more than 750 meters, but deeper horizons may be developed in the future. The leaching agent dissolves the uranium and the sulphuric acid \"production solution\" (containing less than 0.1% uranium) is then extracted through a network of extraction wells and subjected to primary treatment where the uranium is separated using ion exchange resins before it is ready for conversion and enrichment. The ISL technology oﬀers signi\u0000cant advantages over traditional ore mining methods (mine and open pit) in terms of both cost and environmental impact. Since uranium is extracted without removing the host rock and overburden, the capital investment for ore extraction is signi\u0000cantly reduced while minimizing operating costs. This method of mining also has a comparatively lower environmental impact. No dumps or waste rocks are formed, radon emissions are minimized and no toxic dust is generated. There is no need to dispose of the production solution, as it is pumped back into the injection wells for reuse (i.e. re-injection into the ore body) after it has been recovered using an oxidizer and a complexing reagent. This signi\u0000cantly reduces water and sulfuric acid consumption. Groundwater contamination is facilitated by maintaining a pressure diﬀerential at the wellhead, ensuring a uniform \u0000ow to the deposit or ore body from a nearby aquifer and preventing drilling \u0000uids from entering the mine area. ¹ Thus, uranium mining using the ISL method minimizes the environmental impact. Over the last ten years (from 2013 to 2022), the company's annual uranium production reached 24.7 thousand tons of uranium, and by 2022 it decreased to 22.2 thousand tons of uranium. However, rising uranium prices caused both by the general political instability in Niger (4-5% of global production) and the risks of limiting the supply of nuclear fuel from Russia will 1 Monitoring wells are installed above, below and around the mined layer of the"}

AVANTGARDE ADVISORY AND SEEPX ENERGY 234 contribute to the increase in uranium production in Kazakhstan. In September 2023, the uranium price exceeded US$70 per pound of U ₃O₈ oxide and approached the price reached before the Fukushima Daiichi accident (US$73 per pound). In September 2023, the uranium price exceeded $70 per pound of U ₃O₈ uranium oxide and approached the price reached before the Fukushima Daiichi accident ($73 per pound of U ₃O₈ uranium oxide). It is important to note that further aggravation of the con\u0000ict in Ukraine brings additional uncertainty to the development of nuclear energy, which is heavily dependent on Russia, whose share in uranium supply is 14%, in uranium conversion (conversion of uranium into UF6) - 27%, and in uranium enrichment - 39%. Political uncertainty determines the volatility of uranium prices, but the long-term trend of demand growth with certain supply limitation will lead to uranium price growth. The decline in production in the key countries of Australia and Canada in 2013-2022 was due to relatively low uranium prices, which are often unpr o\u0000table for uranium mining using traditional methods. Reduced uranium consumption was also caused by the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and the shutdown of some reactors in Japan and Germany. However, since then, an increasing number of countries are planning or already building nuclear power plants. As a result, the world market's uranium needs will grow 1.5 times by 2035, and the World Nuclear Association estimates that uranium needs will double by 2040. Given the current market conditions, growth in pr o\u0000ts from uranium exports should be expected. Thus, in 2022, the pr o\u0000t of NAC Kazatomprom JSC more than doubled to 472.5 billion KZT ($1.02 billion), while the revenue from uranium sales increased by 40%. The prospects for growth in pr o\u0000ts from uranium mining, as well as the need to secure uranium supplies, will most likely lead to an increase in Kazakhstan's production to 26,000-28,000 tons of uranium per year.

Uranium is a valuable energy resource. While oil and natural gas, once used as fuel, are no longer returned to the fuel cycle, the use of depleted or processed uranium is possible in the nuclear fuel cycle. The growth of uranium production in Kazakhstan raises , \u0000rst of all, the issue of long-term planning for the development and increase of uranium reserves. Uranium reserves The State Balance of Mineral Reserves of the Republic of Kazakhstan lists 56 uranium deposits, of which 6 deposits have only oﬀ-balance reserves. Industrial development involves 78.3% of the balance sheet uranium reserves, for which contracts with subsoil users have been concluded. The division by uranium-ore provinces adopted in the country is shown in Figure 9.4. Within these uranium provinces, the total amount of uranium reserves and resources is more than 1 million tons of uranium. Kazakhstan ranks second in the world in terms of uranium reserves with 13% of the world's uranium reserves. According to SRK Consulting, ore reserves of all mining enterprises of NAC Kazatomprom JSC as of the end of 2022 amounted to 588.8 thousand tons of uranium, while a year earlier Table 9 .1 World ur an\u0000um pr oduct\u0000on 2013-2022, tons of ur an\u0000um. 2013 22451 9331 4323 6350 2400 3135 4518 1500 385 4938 593312017 23321 13116 4224 5882 3400 2917 3449 1692 421 2092 605142015 23607 13325 2993 5654 2385 3055 4116 1616 385 3168 603042019 22808 6938 5476 6613 3500 2911 2983 1885 308 1320 547422014 23127 9124 3255 5001 2400 2990 4057 1500 285 4302 560412018 21705 7001 5525 6517 3450 2904 2911 1885 423 1833 541542016 24689 14039 3654 6315 3325 3004 3479 1616 385 2701 632072020 19477 3885 5413 6203 3500 2846 2991 1885 400 1131 477312021 21819 4693 5753 4192 3520 2635 2248 1600 600 748 478082022 21227 7351 5613 4553 3300 2508 2020 1700 600 483 49355% -5.5% -21.2% 29.8% -28.3% 37.5% -20.0% -55.3% 13.3% 55.8% -16.8%Kazakhstan Canada Namibia Australia Uzbekistan Russia Niger China India Other countries F\u0000gure 9 .3 Es t\u0000mat\u0000on of Kazakhstan's export structure by types of energy resources \u0000n m\u0000ll\u0000ons of tons o f fuel equ\u0000valent. *Estimation is made on the basis that 1 ton of uranium can be used to produce 40 million kWh of electricity, which was generated from heat energy with an eﬃciency of 35%. 93,1 6,6 21,1 298,4Oil Natural gas Coal Uranium *World productionNUCLEAR ENERGY AND URANIUM INDUSTRY 236 F\u0000gure 9 .4 Ur an\u0000um-ore pro v\u0000nces of Kazakhst an and d\u0000s tr\u0000but\u0000on of ur an\u0000um reserves. the reserves amounted to 625.4 thousand tons of uranium.

Until recently, the Ulba Metallurgical Plant (UMP) in Kazakhstan had only reconversion and fuel pellet production among these stages of nuclear fuel production. ² In 2021, production of fuel assemblies for PWR reactors of French design operated at NPPs in China was launched at UMP. In 2022, the joint Kazakh-Chinese enterprise Ulba-FA LLP producing fuel assemblies delivered the \u0000rst batch of fuel assemblies containing about 30 tons of low-enriched uranium. By the end of 2023, it is planned to deliver four batches of fuel assemblies to China, which is more than a hundred tons of uranium equivalent, and in 2024 the company plans to reach the full design capacity of 200 tons of low-enriched uranium in fuel assemblies. Under the cooperation agreements between NAC Kazatomprom JSC and CGN dated 2016, the parties agreed to build a FA production plant located on the territory of UMP JSC. In this case, CGN guarantees the purchase of the plant's products by Ulba-FA LLP, and in return, NAC Kazatomprom JSC agrees to sell a 49% stake in its subsidiary DP Ortalyk LLP in favor of CGN or its aﬃliated company. The source uranium material for the production of Ulba-FA LLP is UMP fuel pellets, which will allow to utilize UMP's production capacity. During the Soviet Union, UMP covered about 80% of the fuel pellets demand of nuclear power plants, and the annual production volume was 1200 tons of low-enriched fuel. Since Kazakhstan's independence, the plant's work until 2008 consisted of ful\u0000lling orders from Rosatom to produce fuel pellets for fuel assembly production in Russia. After 2008, Rosatom refused to place orders for the supply of fuel pellets at UMP in favor of its own production. UMP was forced to reorient from high-tech production of fuel pellets to the production of powdered products from various types of raw materials to supply to the fuel element production plants in other countries. In 2011, a Contract for the supply of enriched uranium product (EUP) and the production of ceramic nuclear fuel pellets was concluded with the Chinese company CGNPC; practical implementation of the Contract began in 2016. Currently, Ulba Metallurgical Plant produces fuel pellets for both Russian-designed VVER reactors and French-designed Framatome PWRs. The production volume of fuel pellets in 2022 2 Enriched uranium is supplied to UMP from enrichment plants in Russia: the Ural Electrochemical Plant and the International Uranium Enrichment Center (IUEC) in Angarsk.Table 9 .3 Volumes of fuel pellets output at UMP, tons 2017 75.22015 102019 86Years 2014 102018 84.32016 242020 60.32021 43.52022 198.2 Fuel pelletsamounted to 198.2 tons. Over three years, the production of fuel pellets at UMP increased 2.3 times, which is extremely important to support the production of high-tech products. 9.4 Prospects of nuclear energy in the world The world's nuclear power plants produced 2,486.8 billion kWh in 2022, which is about 8.5% of global production. T oday, the world's nuclear power industry includes 438 nuclear reactors, which are located in 32 countries and cumulatively produce about 393.8 GW of electricity. Overall, nuclear power capacity growth has been steady over the past decade, increasing by 20.3 GW(e) between 2012 and 2022, with more than 7.4 GW(e) of new capacity connected in 2022 alone, including 5.8 GW(e) in Asia and 1.6 GW(e) in Europe. ³ In 2022, 3.3 GW (5 reactors) of nuclear capacity was permanently shut down. The largest \u0000eet of NPPs in the world belongs to the USA. The 93 power units in operation, with a total capacity of 95.5 GW, produce 18.2% of the country's electricity. At the same time, the USA, which is the leader in the nuclear power industry, is practically not planning to build new nuclear facilities, unlike China, which is building the largest amount of nuclear facilities (18.2 GW). As a result, the fastest growing economies in the Asian region, China and India, are taking over the lead in nuclear power. In recent years, Japan has changed its plans to decommission nuclear power plants and is building new reactors. The government's stated goal is for nuclear power to provide 20-22% of electricity by 2030. In 2011, nuclear power accounted for almost 30% of the country's total electricity production (29% in 2009) with an installed capacity of 47.5 GW, but the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant halted the development of"}

In general, after the Fukushima Daiichi accident, the requirements for modern reactors were signi\u0000cantly strengthened. \"Post- Fukushima\" reactors are already so safe that when the cooling circuit is shut down, the reactor stops and cools itself through the action of natural physical principles - passive safety systems. NUCLEAR ENERGY AND URANIUM INDUSTRY 238 The choice of developing countries towards nuclear power is due to economic and environmental advantages. The environmental impact of NPPs is insigni\u0000cant compared to coal and even hydroelectric power plants, and their operating life exceeds 60 years, which is many times higher than that of unstable wind and solar power plants. Greenhouse gas emissions during NPP operation are insigni\u0000cant, so nuclear power is low-carbon. In terms of reactor technologies, the main focus of NPP construction is on double-circuit thermal neutron reactors with water moderator and coolant (PWR or VVER). Table 9.4 shows that the share of boiling water reactors (BWRs) at NPPs under construction is much smaller than at operating NPPs. Boiling water reactors (BWRs), consisting of a single circuit, have a number of disadvantages: larger dimensions of the vessels of boiling reactors (by a factor of 2 compared to PWRs), more complex reactor control, as well as radiation contamination of the turbine, and as a consequence, the complexity of repair work. Due to the low competitiveness of gas-cooled reactors compared to PWRs and BWRs, NPPs with gas-cooled reactors are not planned for construction. PHWRs fueled by unenriched natural uranium have a number of operational limitations and are also inferior to PWRs and BWRs in terms of their economic performance. New NPPs with PHWRs are being built only in India as part of India's nuclear strategy. ³Figure 9 .5 Capacities (GW) of operating, under construction and planned NPPs.

China, like Russia, has plans to build a closed nuclear fuel cycle, and two power units with CFR-600 fast reactor demonstrators are under construction at Xiapu NPP. Based on operational experience, technical and economic parameters, PWR (VVER) type reactors are the main reactor technology for NPPs under construction. However, the limited resource base is implied by the nuclear power development programs of Russia, China and India. As a result, over time, alternative approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle will become more and more relevant: ► uranium mining from alternative sources; ► transition to uranium-thorium cycle; ► transition to a closed uranium-plutonium cycle. Seawater, which contains up to 3 mg of uranium in one cubic meter, is also considered as an alternative source of uranium. Possibilities of using depleted uranium with its enrichment are also being considered. The main limiting factor in these areas is the uranium price. As reserves are exhausted and the uranium price rises, the pro\u0000tability of alternative sources of uranium will increase. 4 the long-term development program of the Indian nuclear power industry focuses on the PHWR (CANDU type), including its subsequent inclusion in the fuel cycle of thorium, of which India ranks \u0000rst in terms of thorium reserves. .NUCLEAR ENERGY AND URANIUM INDUSTRY 3 In April 2023, the largest EPR reactor in Europe with a capacity of 1600 MW was launched in Finland, but construction of the reactor had been underway since 2005 and was associated with a number of technical diﬃculties. 239 Another approach to replenishing the limited uranium resources is the use of thorium. Thorium is a natural radioactive element. T welve thorium isotopes are known, but natural thorium basically consists of one isotope Th-232. Thorium reserves are signi\u0000cant and distributed in many countries of the world. Thorium as a fuel for NPPs has an advantage - the possibility of formation of \u0000ssile isotope U-233. The transition to the uranium-thorium fuel cycle reduces the need for uranium. The thorium nuclear program is being developed in India, which has signi\u0000cant thorium reserves. Russia has designed a VVER-T reactor using enriched uranium and thorium as fuel. It is possible that the use of thorium as a component of nuclear fuel will help reduce uranium consumption in the future and partially solve the problem of uranium depletion. Another extremely promising and breakthrough area of nuclear power development is the transition to a closed fuel cycle, which involves the widespread use of fast breeder reactors capable of producing \u0000ssile nuclear elements in greater quantities than their consumption. The reprocessing of spent fuel from such reactors makes it possible to replenish the volume of nuclear fuel for both fast breeder reactors and conventional reactors (thermal neutron reactors) with the addition of a small amount of natural or depleted uranium. The need for uranium enrichment would be minimized. According to experts' estimates, in case of transition of nuclear power to a closed fuel cycle, the annual uranium demand will be reduced by more than 200 times. In terms of creating a closed nuclear cycle, Russia is the closest to these technologies. In June 2021, construction of a nuclear power unit with the innovative BREST 300 fast breeder reactor began in Seversk (T omsk Region). The new reactor with lead coolant and new mixed uranium-plutonium nitride fuel, optimal for fast neutron reactors, will have an installed capacity of 300 MW. The BREST-300 reactor will be part of a pilot demonstration"}

Thus, for the \u0000rst time in the world practice, a fast breeder NPP and a stationary closed nuclear fuel cycle will be built on the same site. After reprocessing, spent nuclear fuel will be sent for refabrication (i.e., re-manufacturing of fresh fuel) - thus the NPP in Seversk will operate on a closed fuel cycle. The development of nuclear technologies can solve the problem of depleting uranium reserves and at the same time make nuclear power even safer. Increasing nuclear power capacity will make it possible to replace basic coal-\u0000red power plants in the future and signi\u0000cantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 9.5 Kazakhstan's Reactor Selection In addition to a developed uranium industry, Kazakhstan has substantial experience in operating nuclear reactors. In 1973, Kazakhstan launched a pilot, dual-purpose BN-350 fast breeder reactor with a sodium liquid metal coolant designed to generate steam for both seawater desalination and power generation. Due to the steam generated in the steam generators of the BN-350 reactor plant, the distillate plant fully met the fresh water needs of Aktau city and the region. The design life of the reactor was 20 years, but it was extended and the reactor operated until 1998. In March 1998, the reactor was shut down, and on April 22, 1999, the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan issued a decree to decommission the BN-350 reactor. In addition to the decommissioned BN-350 (MAEK) reactor, Kazakhstan's Kurchatov city has a unique research facilities for nuclear research and nuclear power with a large human resource potential. Research centers, including research reactors and test facilities, were built in Kurchatov as part of the Soviet program to develop a high-temperature nuclear rocket engine. Kazakhstan's leadership since 2009 in the uranium market and the development of uranium industry segments have not yet led to a political decision to build a nuclear power plant (NPP) as the \u0000nal component of the nuclear industry. However, in the adopted concept of Kazakhstan's transition to a \"green\" economy, the construction of NPPs is considered on a par with wind and solar power plants as a measure to move away from coal power, the share of which in Kazakhstan's energy sector remains one of the highest in the world. Neighboring Uzbekistan is already planning the construction of the region's largest nuclear power plant with a capacity of 2.4 GW with Generation 3+ reactors and meeting the highest \"post-Fukushima\" safety requirements. In 2023, Kazakhstan's President K. T okayev proposed to put the issue of NPP construction to a referendum. If the referendum result is positive, Kazakhstan will face the issue of choosing reactor technology. In our opinion, the main criteria for selecting reactor technology should be: ► reactor safety i.e. generation 3+; ► integration into the power system; ► cost and construction time of NPPs with this type of reactors. Despite the start of the nuclear \"renaissance\" in the early 2000s, the Fukushima Daiichi accident has aﬀected the development of nuclear technology. Currently, only a limited number of companies have experience in building and operating nuclear power plants with Generation 3+ reactors. Rosatom has the largest number of operating Generation 3+ reactors. In general, 24 out of 60 reactors under construction are built using Russian technologies, but the sanctions pressure creates certain obstacles to the implementation of NPP projects with Russian reactors. In terms of integration into the energy system, based on the requirements of the country's energy infrastructure, the construction of NPPs with high-capacity reactors is undesirable, because in case of fuel overload or emergency reactor shutdown, up to 6% of the total capacity will be excluded from the country's energy system. Thus, high-capacity reactors, such as EPR 1600 MW and CAP 1400 MW, are not suitable based on the requirements of reliability and stability of the energy system. The choice of reactor technology among the remaining three reactor types (AP 1000, VVER 1200 and IPHWR-700) should be made based primarily on technical and economic indicators. NUCLEAR ENERGY AND URANIUM INDUSTRY 240 9.6 Nuclear power and low- carbon development Coal-\u0000red generation dominates in Kazakhstan and unstable energy sources such as wind and solar power plants are not suﬃcient to replace coal-\u0000red generation capacity as part of low- carbon development. T o replace coal-\u0000red power plants, a reliable source of baseload generation with minimal pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions is needed. Nuclear power plants are such a source. Nuclear power plants have a much lower environmental impact than coal-\u0000red power plants. Despite the fact that coal has been used to generate electricity since the end of the 19th century, it is still the main source of electricity, as it was 100 years ago - the share of coal power in the world balance is about 40%. Of course, it is wrong to compare coal combustion technologies of 100 years ago and now, but nevertheless, there are still factors that have an extremely negative impact on the environment, making coal power the most \"harmful\" to the environment. The main negative factor of coal power generation is associated with the emission of sulfur and nitrogen oxides, heavy metals, as well as with the problem of storage of large volumes of ash generated as a result of coal combustion. Emission of sulphur and nitrogen oxides results in acid rain, which has a negative impact on the ecosystem and human health. Emission of heavy metals (including mercury) is a result of their natural presence in fossil fuels. Heavy metals tend to accumulate in the body, producing neurotoxic eﬀects. Radioactive substances present in fossil fuels after combustion of hard coal, lignite or peat remain and are concentrated in the ash. Depending on the coal deposit the concentrations of natural radioactive isotopes in ash exceed the corresponding concentrations in coal by 2 - 15 times, thus, coal ash from some deposits can be referred to radioactive waste. Ash dumps generated"}

Ash dumps in combination with arid climate and constant winds, which is typical for Kazakhstan, lead to signi\u0000cant dusting and pollution of adjacent territories. Nuclear power plants, despite the presence of radioactive fuel and waste, are characterized by strict localization of radioactive materials. From the economic point of view, nuclear power has the lowest dependence of the cost of generated electricity on \u0000uctuations in fuel prices. The economic advantages also include signi\u0000cant operating life of nuclear power plants of more than 60 years, whereas for coal-\u0000red power plants - 40 years, for ga s-\u0000red power plants - no more than 30 years. When making a decision to build a nuclear power plant, it is necessary to consider that the nuclear power plant will provide electricity for several generations of the country's residents. Kazakhstan is considering a wide list of potential sites for NPPs, including the village of Ulken on the western shore of Lake Balkhash, the cities of Kostanai, Kurchatov and Taraz. 9.7 Key ndings and recommendations ► Given the increase in uranium mining volumes, it is necessary to increase the share of pr o\u0000ts allocated to geological exploration to increase uranium reserves. It is necessary to develop a long-term strategy for geological exploration and uranium reserves growth. ► The launch of the fuel assembly plant is a great achievement for Kazakhstan's industry, and the possibility of increasing nuclear fuel production by expanding production or increasing productivity should be explored. ► The Kazakhstani leadership needs to convince the population of the bene\u0000ts of nuclear power development, which will be a diﬃcult task given the country's historical experience with the consequences of the extended nuclear weapons tests at the Semipalatinsk test site. ► The choice of reactor technologies is rather limited, but in case of NPP construction the choice should be made only among modern Generation 3+ reactors.Table 9 .5 Generation 3+ reactor technologies.

The oil and gas industry is truly global and feeds into the majority of human activities. The oil and gas industry has been the backbone of the rapid economic development in Kazakhstan in the 2000s. However, reliance on commodity production is not a sustainable national economic strategy for many reasons, including susceptibility to currency fluctuations, exposure to external shocks, and limited opportunities for employment growth. From a development perspective, commodities can be used as a platform to build on existing competitive advantage and develop opportunities to increase local participation in the production chain. This report identifies Kazakhstan’s position and upgrading trajectories in the oil and gas global value chain (GVC), drawing on best practices of resource-rich countries. The key finding of the report is that the oil-field services subsector generates most of the value and develops most of the innovations in the oil and gas GVC. The dynamics of the oil and gas value chain are determined by a tiered system of lead firms and suppliers that historically have created a tight network of companies. To be competitive in the chain dominated by multinational lead firms, suppliers must demonstrate the capability of its workforce and technical capacity to meet lead firms’ standards. The task of the host country is to remove barriers for local firms to participate in the chain and to design its supporting policies accordingly. For Kazakhstan, as the study finds out, expanding participation in the value chain means improving the quality of its human capital so local companies are able to move into more sophisticated services, and to alter its local content policies so that Kazakhstan’s companies can enter the production portion of the chain, gradually expanding their participation in the global industry. Best international practices suggest that a participatory approach to industry challenges and local capacity building are essential for the development and implementation of successful government policies. The report reviews the human capital development and local content policies in the U.K., Norway, Canada, Australia and Russia to identify international best practices. Given the high level of participation of the Government in the industry through regulation and the national oil gas company— KazMunayGas—the recommendations are as follows: • Create a comprehensive workforce development strategy with participation of all stakeholders. Connecting educational institutions with private sector in a meaningful way, improving teaching standards and establishing opportunities for lifelong education are important elements of such strategy. • Set a coherent policy framework and institutions to promote upgrading and local participation in the industry, instead of market distorting percentage targets. Local oil-field service industry needs capability development tools (for instance, business skills training), improved access to finance, support in technology transfer and export efforts. Besides, liberalization and increase in transparency of policy-making, licensing and procurement practices are paramount to enhance the efficiency of the local industry. 5 1. Introduction Globalization became a buzzword in the late 20th century and, despite rising waves of protectionism, remains embedded in the way economies function today. Fragmentation of global production and intensification of trade flows induced new thinking around the phenomenon. Researchers from various fields study global “integration of trade” and “disintegration of production,” focusing on strategies"}

One of the structured frameworks to understand global industries and development opportunities is the GVC framework developed by the Center on Globalization, Governance and Competitiveness at Duke University, which seeks to identify a country’s (or a firm’s) potential to advance in a particular value chain (Gereffi 2005; Gereffi 2001). The fragmentation of production processes and a significant increase in the number of buyers, sellers and intermediaries resulted in the emergence of different patterns of distribution of power and profits between them. The GVC methodology analyzes the industries’ economic geography, the linkages among the stages of value creation, the governance structure of the supply chain and strategies to capture more value. (Sturgeon 2008). Thus, GVC analysis covers all activities related to production of goods or services, from raw materials to factors of production, delivery for final use and post-sale services, if relevant (Cattaneo 2010). In today’s interconnected global economy, the question that countries face is not whether to participate in global production chains, but how to participate effectively. Applying GVC analysis is essential for a small open economy such as Kazakhstan that recently joined WTO in 2015. The country developed a strong dependence on a single commodity; in 2015, crude oil accounted for 59 percent of its total exports. The prolonged decline in oil prices has had a major impact on Kazakhstan’s economic performance, with a subsequent decline in the rate of economic growth from 6 percent in 2013 to 4.2 percent in 2014 to 1.2 percent in 2015, and finally to 0.4 percent in the first nine months of 2016. The decline in economic performance due to reduced oil prices has once again accentuated the need to diversify the country’s economy and exports. Understanding how GVCs operate and mapping Kazakhstan’s position in them is critical for a developing country that seeks to create jobs, attract foreign investments, increase productivity and generate higher value within the country. There are six different trajectories for a country or a firm to “upgrade” or expand in GVCs (The Philippines 2016). Use of a concrete upgrading strategy in GVCs depends on leveraging existing competitive advantages, including geographic location, human capital, and potent local suppliers. GVC frameworks feature the following upgrading trajectories. Changing one’s position in a GVC starts with entry into the value chain; as knowledge accumulates, product upgrading means creating a more sophisticated product with a higher value; process upgrading means efficiency enhancement in production processes; functional upgrading describes acquisition of new skills to move into higher value segments of the chain; chain upgrading leverages accrued knowledge and technology to move into another value chain; and, finally, end-market upgrading means entering new, higher value, premium markets (GVC Primer 2016). GVC analysis helps identify the best trajectory for upgrading given local capabilities, and provides opportunities for development that do not solely rely on functional upgrading, which in many developing countries may not the optimal strategy to pursue, at least in the short term, due to local company capabilities (The Philippines 2016). The aim of this study is to consider opportunities for Kazakhstan’s greater participation in the global oil industry. The report examines the distribution of value across the oil and gas value chain, the existing governance model between lead firms and suppliers, the geographic distribution of production and trade flows, and the institutional structure of the oil and gas value chain. 6 The report is structured as follows: First, it analyzes the world oil and gas industry from a GVC perspective, covering the chain’s key elements, its global distribution, the role of lead firms and the role of standards. Then, the study considers upgrading—an important concept in GVC analysis—and the upgrading trajectories that oil producers undertook. The fourth part of the report continues to upgrading potential of the oil-field service industry. Based on the analysis, the final part of the report draws some key policy recommendations, which take into account institutional environment and important role of the Government in the sector. 2. Methodology This report draws on two analytical components: “desk research” and “field study” . Box 1 provides a detailed description of the methodology and its components. The first component includes analysis of academic and business literature. The second one builds on interviews with industry stakeholders— oil and oil-field companies, industry associations, government bodies and education institutions, in Kazakhstan and abroad. Box 1. Global Value Chain (GVC) Methodology GVC analysis includes all the activities conducted by firms which are necessary for the production of goods and services and their delivery to the final consumer. These activities can be carried out by one or more firms, and includes research and development, design, production, marketing, distribution and final sale. A chief purpose of GVC analysis is to identify opportunities for economic, social and environmental upgrading. The GVC methodology is based on the analysis of six main dimensions that are divided in global and local. Global dimensions analyze the industry dynamic at the international level, and local elements examine the country’s participation in GVC. Global dimensions include: (1) Input-output structure (production factors—products) defines the process of transforming raw (source) materials into a finished product or service. The input-output structure considers the range of steps needed to create a product (or service) from raw materials, to component production and final assembly, to delivery to the final consumer. This dimension takes into account main and subsidiary activities and tangible and intangible goods and services. The components of the chain differ depending on the industry. In general, they may include research and development, engineering and design, materials, manufacturing and distribution, marketing and final sales. After-consumption disassembly or disposal is often considered. The analysis of each segment of the chain shows its contribution to formation of the product’s value added. (2) Geographic scope analyzes the industry’s presence in other countries. The main goal is to understand the geography of trade in the global industry, especially the key importing and exporting countries, and shifts over time. Geographic scope considers supply and demand at the global level based on"}

In additional, various industry publications, firms’ reports, expert opinions and other sources are analyzed to understand key trends. Geographic scope can be considered on local, national, regional and global levels. (3) Governance structure: Lead firms & industry organization defines the source of control in a GVC. Examining the governance structure of an industry helps to understand the relationship between firms in the chain, especially with regard to its coordination and control functions. This phase of the analysis identifies the lead firms in the industry and other information, including their location, interaction with suppliers and customers, and enforcement action such as standards and other regulatory documents. There are five key industry governance types: market, modular, relational, captive and hierarchy, which are determined by three factors: the complexity of the information shared between actors in the chain; how the information for production can be codified; and the level of supplier competence: 7 • Market governance assumes that operations between various players are carried out easily, the specification of goods is simple, and producers can create a product without close contact with the buyer. The price of a product is a major factor, and buyers are not connected with suppliers formally through long-term contracts or in other forms. • Modular governance prevails in chains where transactions are relatively easy to codify. Producers manufacture products in accordance with the requirements of a large number of customers, • Relational governance is formed when complexity of the data used by sellers and buyers in transactions complicates their transfer or complicates training. Establishment of such communications is based on reputation, geographical or cultural proximity, or affinity. In such a model, leading companies have a greater influence on the suppliers than vice versa. • In captive governance the leading companies-buyers are usually small in number, and suppliers are numerous; therefore, the formers have a significant influence on the latter by conducting monitoring of their activities and dictating terms of cooperation (GVC Primer 2016). The reason is that the lead firm controls creation of complex products with strong characteristics in case of low supplier competence (Gereffi et al. 2005). • Hierarchical governance usually emerges in vertically integrated chains, which are controlled by the lead multinational companies. Products and services are developed and produced within one company. This usually occurs in a case where the technical specifications of this product have a high degree of complexity, information is very difficult to codify or there are few other qualified suppliers in the market. Local dimensions include: (4) Upgrading improves the position of a firm (or country) in a value chain . When analyzing opportunities for upgrading, the following types of upgrading are taken into consideration: • Process upgrading: more efficient transformation of inputs into outputs by reorganizing the production system or the introduction of improved technologies. • Product upgrading: transition to more difficult manufacturing lines. • Functional upgrading: acquisition of new functions to increase the general of skills of activity (Humphrey et al. 2002) • Chain or intersectorial upgrading: entry into a new chain due to the knowledge and skills received in the current chain. • In GVC literature the next types of upgrading are determined: • Entry into the value chain: the start of participation in a GVC. • Improved backward linkages: the ability of local firms (domestic or foreign) to produce formerly imported goods in a GVC. • End-market upgrading: entry into the market with higher value added, for which a geographical or a sectorial shift may be necessary. Recently, the literature has begun to quote other types of upgrading, including social and ecological upgrading. (5) The analysis of institutional context identifies the influence of local and international policies on globalization processes in each segment of a chain . Participation of companies in global industries is associated not only with the ability to produce to buyers’ standards, but with the regulatory and organizational support structure that constitutes the economic, social and environmental context of production. Formal legal requirements on a variety of economic, social and environmental topics, including those that facilitate the development of physical and human infrastructure, are important for many GVCs. Organizations relevant to GVCs include industry organizations, educational institutions, and regulatory bodies. (6) Industry stakeholders. Industry stakeholders include all participants in the value chain. Analysis of stakeholders’ role in industry GVC is also carried out. Such approach allows for identifying of how various characteristics of institutional environment (in the different countries and regions) influence economic and social indicators. (GVC Primer 2016). 8 The first stage—desk research—utilized industry reports and statistical databases such as UN Comtrade Statistics Database, U.S. Energy Information Administration and BP Statistical Database. Specifically, the six-digit SITC codes were used to identify direction and dynamics of global trade flows in oil, gas and oil-based products. The data on Kazakhstan’s production, processing and international trade in hydrocarbons and refined oil products comes from the national Statistics Committee. All data was drawn for 2000-15. Trade data included volumes, dollar value and destinations of flows. The second stage – field research – occurred after understanding the global hydrocarbon value chain functions and Kazakhstan’s place within it. To better understand the oil and gas industry, its bottlenecks and potential upgrading trajectories in Kazakhstan, NAC conducted a survey with industry stakeholders. The list of interviewees included ministries of energy and investment and development, foreign and Kazakhstan oil-field service companies, scientific research institutes, information and analytical centers, education institutions in Kazakhstan and the U.S., and the Nova Scotia Department of Energy (Canada). In addition, meetings were held with industry associations and experts in the energy sector and oil and gas service. Specific questionnaires were developed for each group of respondents. Having described the methods used to develop the insights and recommendations, the report now turns to the analysis of the oil and gas GVC and Kazakhstan’s participation in the chain. 3.

Advancement of technology made large “unconventional reserves” available at a competitive price . Market disruption of 2014-15 induced fundamental transformation of the oil and gas industry. North America has become an exporter of hydrocarbons, and world supply of oil has greatly increased. 2. Global demand shifts to the East . China, India and Japan combined account for 40 percent of world oil imports. The rest of Asia has also increased its consumption of fuels as economies grow and people’s incomes rise. 3. Environmental policies and the development of renewable energy create downward pressure on oil and gas prices . Hydrocarbon producers are diversifying their energy portfolio away from oil and are turning into energy producers, more generally. 4. However, the current drop in investments will eventually push prices up . Oil and gas producers seeking to optimize production costs, have frozen their investments in complex and expensive projects. As a result of growing competition, not only among oil producers but with other sources of energy, industry margins will remain tight. Decreased upstream investments for the last two years likely will not lead to the same comfortable level of margins as in 2011-14 (International Energy Agency 2016). 5. A global talent gap is emerging due to the industry’s cyclical nature . A large number of aging professionals are leaving the industry while the education system, also prone to cyclical booms and busts, does not produce an adequate volume of graduates. New industries such as IT, high-tech and finance became more attractive to talented youth in the 2000s. 9 1 The share of each segment in the total sector value added is calculated based on Kazakhstan’s gross value added statistics for the oil and gas industry in 2015.3.2. Value Chain Overview Key segments of the oil and gas value chain are exploration, production (or extraction), storage and transportation, refining, and marketing and distribution. Each of the segments involve a number of activities and employ a range of factors of production (Figure 1; percentage of value added at each stage of the chain is shown in parentheses). Supporting organizations and institutions create an environment under which oil and gas companies operate. Their quality and nature has significant influence over configuration of the chain, the way it functions and, largely, upgrading trajectories. Figure 1.

Exploration aims at searching for the hydrocarbon reservoir beneath the Earth’s surface. 2. Production (extraction) is the process of bringing the hydrocarbons from the reservoir to the surface. 3. Transportation of oil and gas includes movement from the oil and gas fields to processing facilities and from those facilities to the end market. 4. Refining is an industrial process converting hydrocarbons into fuels, lubricant oils and petrochemical feedstock. 5. Distribution and final sales include branding petrochemical products and delivering them to customers via marketing base—directly to industrial or residential customers, gas stations or petrochemical plants. Exploration and Production (E&P) segments are referred to as upstream oil and gas. Infrastructure such as transport (pipelines, access to roads, rail and ports, etc.) and storage are critical at various stages in the value chain, including the links between production and processing facilities, and between processing and final customer. These parts of the value chain are midstream . Refining and Distribution (R&D) and final sale are referred to as downstream (World Bank 2011). 10 2 Hypothesis regarding highest marginal value per barrel in production is validated in literature, personal communcations with industry experts and statistical data from Kazakhstan’s GDP data. Notably, R&D are crucial in all segments of the value chain, with distribution and final sale as probably the only exception. R&D inherently matter for a complex and hazardous activity of hydrocarbon extraction, transportation over long distances and treatment. The oil and gas industry is very capital-intensive and involves many direct (such as drilling, recovery or equipment manufacturing) and complimentary activities (such as construction, chemicals, etc.). Production segment is where the most value is created 2, while the rest of the segments depend on a steady supply of oil and operate on economies of scale. Thus, when moving into midstream and in downstream segments, the value created per barrel becomes lower (Figure 2). Major production companies, for instance, Royal Dutch Shell makes two-thirds of its profits from E&P of crude despite being vertically integrated structures (petroleum.co.uk). Besides, prices in the midstream and downstream segments are sticky, often regulated for social reasons, and their margins are determined by the fluctuations in oil price (Seba 2008). Figure 2. Oil and Gas Production System Source: NAC The production phase is typically operated by large multinational companies (MNCs) companies, which are the lead in the industry— such as ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Sinopec, Royal Dutch Shell, PetroChina, Saudi Aramco, Total , etc. Historically, oil companies started as production units and then integrated vertically along the value chain to ensure access to transportation routes, refining facilities and consumer markets. These firms often outsource temporary activities such as drilling and well service to smaller service companies in order to decrease MNCs’ costs. 3.3. Geographic Scope While the Middle East remains the largest oil producing and exporting region, it gradually loses its influence over the global oil market. The Middle East possesses almost half of global oil reserves (with Saudi"}

Crude Oil Export Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration The U.S. has become a decisive producer of oil and gas. Figure 4 shows that U.S. shale production picked up recently, replacing a significant part of petroleum imports. Since 2010, the U.S. completed roughly 20,000 new shale wells (Economist 2014). The country’s export of oil products rose from 4 to 13 percent of the world’s export volume over the past decade, having a profound effect on the global market. With the lift of the U.S. ban on crude oil export in December 2015 (BBC 2015), the country has the potential to further increase its export of hydrocarbons and oil-based products. Global supply is becoming more diversified. “Newcomers,” in addition to the U.S., demonstrate strong growth of oil production. Brazil has increased its oil production by 52 percent over the past decade. Post-Soviet Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan aggressively increased production as well. Kazakhstan doubled production since the beginning of 2000s, and Azerbaijan almost tripled it (BP 2015). 12 While Europe and North America decrease consumption, developing regions emerge as new consumers of hydrocarbons .

Lead Firms and Governance Structure The oil and gas value industry is highly consolidated. The industry features relatively accessible technology, but its capital intensity favors the establishment of integrated companies with access to technology and financial and human resources. Integration allows companies to reach economies of scale (horizontal integration), economies of scope (vertical integration) and lower their costs (World Bank 2011). Primarily, there are three tiers of companies in the oil industry. Vertically integrated international and national oil companies (IOCs and NOCs) are Tier 1 (Figure 14). They operate in all segments of the value chain and manage them, given that supply of crude is the source of power in the chain. Among the world’s top players, there are privately owned and state-owned legal entities. Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil are private IOCs, while Saudi Aramco is a state-owned NOC (Luis F. Ayala H. 2009).5 The world’s 10 largest oil and gas companies are integrated horizontally (operate globally) and vertically (operate in all segments of oil and gas value chain). The second and third levels are represented by oil service companies (OSCs) and their suppliers (materials, equipment, services) . These firms provide services directly to the Tier 1 companies and serve as suppliers to all segments of the chain. OSCs emerged when major players started outsourcing noncore activities for efficiency gains. In 2014, the size of the global oil-field service market surpassed US $400 billion (Doshi, Corrigan et al. (2015)). The biggest players in oil services are Halliburton, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, Transocean, Weatherford, Archer . Box 2 describes the emergence and the role of the oil-field service industry. 5 Most of the NOCs, which were established in developing countries in the 1970’s, and started to compete with MNCs in transportation and processing, are still less efficient in terms of costs, investments and corporate strategies, and lag behind in the level of technological sophistication. Source: NAC Figure 13. Organization of Production System in the Oil and Gas Industry 16 Box 2. Emergence of oil-field service industry Up to the 1960s, producing companies executed all operations at the oil field and conducted R&D in-house. In the 1970s and 1980s, drilling and maintenance works increasingly became outsourced as specialized companies were more efficient in these temporary and relatively low-value activities. The outsourcing trend has gained more popularity, allowing oil and gas companies to focus on field development, project management, data interpretation, risk management, etc. Prior to the oil shock of 1990s, oil-field services were relatively simple and low-value. However, price decreases forced oil companies to seek cost reduction and innovative solutions, which were consequently offered by the service industry. Taking from that, producing companies decreased their spending on research, while oil service started increasing its R&D investments and developed breakthrough technologies, including 3-D seismic surveys and horizontal drilling.

The role of oil- field service companies in production, thereby, will grow, and they deserve their nickname of “unsung horses” of the oil industry, as suggested by The Economist (KPMG 2016). Table 2 illustrates the global leaders in each Tier. Large IOCs and NOCs in Tier 1 are typically engaged in the development of a project and its management, and have a large network of suppliers of goods and services. In Tier 2 , there are more specialized service companies engaged in specific types of works and services (Schlumberger, Halliburton). Tier 3 includes even more specialized suppliers of goods, including manufacturers of equipment, tools and chemicals, and service providers (GE Industrial Solutions, SINOPEC Engineering).

Lead firms, 2015 Source: Financial Times, Bloomberg, corporate reports, NAC 17 The refining industry is less consolidated than the exploration and production segment. The rising role of state-owned companies and the shift of the economic gravity have moved refining closer to its customers. State refineries, often owned by NOCs and IOCs, as well as large chemical manufacturers and small independent refiners, are typical players in the segment. For instance, in Kazakhstan, large refineries belong to the state holding company “Samruk-Kazyna”; the Indian government owns shares of the country’s largest refineries—Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum (Bloomberg 2016). The final sale segment is the least concentrated segment of the chain, as it does not involve complicated technologies. The source of power in this segment is flexibility of supply and trading. Customers consider fuels as a commodity; there is not much differentiation among them, allowing for diversity and competition among sellers. However, the high level of competition and insignificant variance among suppliers are typical only for fuel sales. Despite consolidation of market power in the hands of integrated major companies, privatization and liberalization have become long-term trends in the industry. 3.5. Institutions and Standards The industry uses several thousand standards . Given high risks and complexity of the business, public and private actors develop and maintain strict health, safety and environmental (HSE) standards and regulations based on the knowledge from exploitations of oil fields around the world. Standards of individual companies—operators that are used repeatedly to cater to the company’s projects—often serve as a source of industry wide standards and regulations. As a rule, IOCs often maintain the strictest operational and HSE protocols due to the history of working in various conditions internationally, as well as to public pressure. National regulators widely use standards developed by the industry (OGP 2010). International and national standardization bodies and industry organizations serve as sources of standards too. Specific needs of the industry—harsh environments, and hazards for human and environmental well-being—have determined the need for specialized equipment and materials. For instance, American Petroleum Institute has produced most of equipment and materials standards, as well as standards for related processes/operations that are recognized internationally and used in conditions similar to those in North America. The industry also makes use of standards that are nonspecific to oil and gas, but are accepted by professional associations such as American Society of Mechanical Engineers or National Association of Corrosion Engineers (Producers March 2010). The host country’s laws define the general operating framework for oil and gas companies. Governments try to maximize its benefits from the industry and often use standards and regulations not only to maintain environmental and labor security, but also to promote interests of local firms, and increase budget revenues (fines, payments, accreditation). The hierarchy of the typical regulatory framework applicable to all segments of the value chain is shown in Figure 15 below (OGP 2010). Differences in the national regulation, companies’ regulation, and the need to comply with the growing number of standards and regulations obviously increase the complexity of operational environment for the firms. 18 4Figure 14.

Oil and Gas Industry of Kazakhstan Kazakhstan is the 16th largest oil producer in the world and the second largest producer in Eurasia after Russia. In terms of oil reserves, the country takes 12th place, just behind Nigeria, with proved oil reserves of 30 billion barrels as of December 2015 (BP 2016). The country enjoyed rapid economic growth in 2000s due to the quick rise of oil output (Figure 16) and favorable price environment. Oil is the most important export item. Its share in the country’s total export grew from 49 percent in 2000 to 59 percent in 2015, reaching almost 70 percent of exports at the peak price in 2014 (Figure 17). The country"}

Main oil products produced and traded by Kazakhstan internationally are gasoline, diesel and fuel oil. Over the last 10 years, there has been a growth in exports of fuel oil, a low value added product. In the segments of higher value light petroleum products (motor and aviation gasoline chart in Figure 17), the country is a net importer. Kazakhstan’s gas reserves are relatively small—0.9 billion cubic meters, or 0.5 percent of the world total reserves (BP 2016). 19 Kazakhstan became a large oil producer in the 1970s . Many of the current oil fields were discovered and developed at that time. Construction of the major pipeline connected Kazakhstan’s oil fields with refineries in Russia and opened the market for Kazakh oil. The first foreign company to negotiate hydrocarbon production in Kazakhstan was Chevron. The negotiations on the development of the Tengiz field started in 1989, when Kazakhstan was still a part of the Soviet Union. After the dissolution of USSR in 1991, Kazakhstan did not have resources or capacity to develop its subsoil reserves. The government signed exploration contracts with IOCs 6 and after reserves in North Caspian were confirmed, signed production agreements. In 1993, Kazakhstan and Chevron signed “the contract of the century” and established joint venture “Tengizchevroil” to extract hydrocarbons at the giant field (Tengizchevroil 2016). The same year, the government of Kazakhstan and IOCs such as Agip, BP, Statoil, BG, Mobil, Total and Shell signed agreements on exploration in the Caspian shelf. During the first years of independence, the country offered lenient conditions to foreign oil companies signing production sharing agreements (PSAs). These types of agreements particularly suits countries with developing or transitional economies that do not possess financial or technical resources for independent field development (IIED 2012). After abolishment of the PSA regime in 2011,7 subsoil users have to acquire license to conduct exploration and production activities.

KMG group consists of 220 companies. KMG is a vertically integrated oil and gas company present in all segments of the petroleum value chain. KMG and its subsidiaries account for 28 percent of petroleum liquids production, and 16 percent of natural and associated gas production. The group provides 65 percent of transportation pipeline services, 77 percent of sea transportation from Aktau port and 95 percent of gas pipeline transportation within Kazakhstan. It takes a lead position in refining, with 82 percent of total oil processing, and accounts for 17 percent of refined products market. KMG’s publicly listed arm, “KMG Exploration & Production” (KMG E&P), is the main production unit ; however, KMG also owns shares in the field operating companies; a number of service, transportation and consulting companies; and major refining plants (Figure 18). KMG possesses substantial resource base—over 1 billion tons. Nonetheless, most of the company’s operating oil fields are mature, past their production peak. Production at these fields is profitable at Brent price US $40 per barrel or higher. The recent decline in oil price and accumulated debt due to acquisitions of stakes in the major projects squeezed KMG’s profit margins, pushing it to cut costs and even sell 10 percent of the shares to Kazakhstan’s central bank. The move is a disguised US $4 billion loan. KMG represents the government in Kazakhstan’s largest oil projects of (see Ошибка! Источник ссылки не найден.3) and serves its social aims too. Social obligations explicitly or implicitly placed on the company by the government add to KMG’s burden. The company operates in Western Kazakhstan’s areas, where the oil and gas sector may be the only employer. Since 2011, the decline in oil recovery and prices led to strikes, creating tensions in the region. KMG is now forced to maintain its unprofitable subsidiaries, financing (or subsidizing) service companies, which employ around 9,000 people in total, for social reasons. These companies specialize in temporary activities, which are uncompetitive and kept afloat to provide jobs in the oil-producing regions of the country.5Figure 18.

Oil and Gas Producers in Kazakhstan 22 Source: www.tengizchevroil.com/about/overview, KMG R&M Annual Report 2014, http://bnews.kz/ Business climate for oil and gas companies has been changing significantly. The history of policy toward extractive industries can be divided into the following periods: 1. In 1991-2004, the goal was to attract foreign investors by offering favorable investment conditions . At the early stages of industry development, PSAs allowed the government to take advantage of investors’ expertise and technology. According to PSA terms, investors’ expenses are reimbursed with hydrocarbons produced and at a later stage, after initial expenses have been covered, producers start paying taxes. Since that moment, the government’s share in production gradually increases. 2. In 2004-08, Kazakh government was establishing its positions in the sector. Legislation changes in early 2000s aimed to increase taxation of extractive industries to benefit the rest of the economy. General taxes, such as corporate income tax and VAT, were reduced from 30 and 20 percent to 20 and 12 percent, respectively, while new taxes on extractive industry were introduced. PSAs were abolished, and the stability clause was removed from the tax code. The government increased its shares in large projects through buyouts of shares from foreign companies, e.g. KMG purchased half of BG’s share or 8.33 percent in the North Caspian project in 2005 and dissolved smaller PSAs in 2010. 3. The period from 2009 to present time covers aftermath of the crisis characterized by wide fluctuations in the price of oil , and policy initiatives were aiming to maximize government profit. After hitting a record US $143 per barrel and falling sharply in 2008, Brent price rose to US $126 per barrel in 2009 and plummeted to around US $30 in 2016. During this period, the Kazakhstani government increased, decreased or abolished export duties for many times to sustain high income from customs duties and to react to investors’ concerns of increased burden, when prices were low. Overall, there is inconsistency in the policy toward extractive industries; regulation and taxation change frequently. Firms also express dissatisfaction with the quality of tax administration. Surveys show that firms in Kazakhstan get more visits from tax and other authorities than in other countries of Central Asia and Eastern Europe (OECD 2012). Maximizing returns from reserves is linked to the stabilization of production levels. Production is expected to grow significantly only at the offshore giant Kashagan field. There are also a number of smaller fields discovered in the 2000s, which have not struck oil yet. However, the rest of the oil fields are in decline, and the cost of oil production in Kazakhstan is relatively high. For instance, development of Kashagan oilfield, which is expected to be the main source of Kazakhstan’s production growth, is already the world’s most expensive project, and its launch was postponed for two years, from 2014 to 2016, building up the investors’ costs and contributing to stagnant oil production. At the current level of technology, oil production in Kazakhstan is projected to sustain its levels or rise insignificantly (Figure 19).

The main transportation mode for Kazakhstan’s oil is pipelines. The country is far from major trade routes and depends on Russia to transit its oil to the world markets. State-owned company KazTransOil JSC, subsidiary of KMG, is the largest pipeline service provider. Major export routes are Caspian pipeline consortium (CPC), which transported 38 million tons in 2015; Atyrau-Samara pipeline to Russia, 15.7 million tons during the same period; Atasu- Alashankou pipeline from Western Kazakhstan to Western China, 11.8 million tons; and Aktau seaport, 7 million tons. The rest of oil production (1.5 million tons) was transported by railway; some condensate (0.3 million tons) was exported via pipeline to Orenburg refinery. Kazakhstan’s gas value chain is relatively short. Major gas reserves are in Karachaganak field (46 percent), Tengiz (12 percent) and Imashevskoe (7 percent). There are only a few pure dry natural gas fields in Kazakhstan; most of the gas comes as condensate associated with petroleum liquids from oil wells, and about one-fourth of it is injected back into the well to sustain the pressure. 6Figure 19.

Forecast of Gas Production and Re-Injection, 2014-30, million cubic meters 24 Gas fields are located in the western part of Kazakhstan, and given the country’s vast territory and harsh climate, its delivery to other regions requires significant investments. According to energy producers’ association KAZENERGY forecast (Figure 20), the republic will face gas deficit in the midterm as demand outpaces supply, which is limited by oil production needs—almost 40 percent of gas is re- injected back to sustain pressure. Therefore, current research will focus on oil value chain only. Although Kazakhstan refines oil and potentially participates in the refining segment of the GVC, the country does not export refined products.9 Three major refineries that belong to KMG and a few independent mini-refinery plants represent the segment in Kazakhstan. Crude is supplied to domestic refineries at a discount price as part of production agreements with foreign companies. As of 2015, production contracts guaranteed the annual supply of 3 million tons for domestic market, although market demand was around 15 million tons. A regulated market of refined petroleum products often creates a shortage of fuels, especially during high seasonal demand periods. Therefore, the government banned exports of distillates and arranged swap agreements with Chinese and Russian refineries, exchanging crude for refined products. 4.2. Kazakhstan’s Position in Oil and Gas Value Chain The analysis of oil and gas value chain development builds on analysis of evolution of the types of economic activities within each segment of the chain. Types of economic activities have been identified according to the General classification of types of economic activities (hereinafter – GCEA) (Figure 21). 7Figure 21. Oil and Gas GVC GCEA (49.5) Pipeline transportationGCEA (06.1 and 06.2) Production of crude petroleum and natural gasGCEA (47.30) Domestic tradeGCEA (19) Production of coke, refined petroleum products GCEA (09.1) Mining support service activities GCEA (22) Production of rubber and plastic productsExploration (~2-5%)Production (~60%)Transportation (~10-15%)Refining (~7%)Distribution & Final sale (~20-25%) Source: Ministry of National Economy, Committee on Statistics (KZ) Figure 21. Oil and Gas GVC During 2010-15, the largest growth—in terms of number employees and level of wages— occurred in the production segment and related technical services. Particularly, during these last five years, number of employees grew by 21 percent, or 14,500 people (Figure 22), while average monthly wage increased by 119 percent, or 370,000 tenge (Figure 23). 9 KMG International, an arm of KMG, owns majority shares in Rompetrol and Petromidia refining plants and distribution brands in Europe, based in Romania. However, there is no export of refined products from Kazakhstan, except for low value fuel oil. 25 As mentioned earlier, the largest share of value added is created at the production stage. In Kazakhstan, particularly, production of oil and gas and mining-related services 10 account for 60 percent of value added in Kazakhstan’s oil and gas sector (Ministry of National Economy, Committee on Statistics (KZ) 2015). Low share of value added in the Refining segment—only 7 percent of the sector’s GVA in 2015— looks counterintuitive; however, it can be explained by the ongoing modernization program, and the fundamental reason may be the low depth of refining. Domestic production of oil products meets around 78 percent of the country’s demand. Since 2008-09, Kazakhstani refineries are undergoing massive modernization to increase refinery depth from current 63 to 74 percent, to 90 percent, and upon completion in 2017, they are expected to fully cover domestic demand for oil-based products until 2020. Taking into account that the largest exporters of oil-based products in the region—Russia, China, Iran, Azerbaijan—increase and upgrade their refining capacities in order to export to Central Asian countries and Mongolia (Petromarket Research Group 2016), we believe that Kazakhstan’s refining industry should aim to meet domestic demand without investing in export capacity. In our view, a potential pathway to add value in Kazakhstan’s oil and gas industry lies in oil-field services, the most technologically advanced and mobile sector related to oil and gas. 10 Considering that Kazakh oil and gas companies prevail in mining sector, we assume that oil-field service companies comprise majority of enterprises in the activity “Mining support"}

Oil-Field Service Industry in Kazakhstan 5.1. Assessment of Kazakhstan’s Capacity in the Oil-Field Industry According to the analysis and interviews conducted by NAC, Kazakhstani companies are present in each segment of the value chain. Figure 24 illustrates the niche of Kazakhstani producers (services provided by local firms are highlighted in blue) against the rising value scale on the left. The scale and positioning are approximate; assessment is prepared by NAC staff over the course of interviews. The striking feature is the import dependence of the oil and gas industry in terms of equipment, which comprises the largest share of capital expenses . Currently, more than one thousand companies with approximately 170,000 people work in Kazakhstan’s oil services market. O il services can be roughly divided into five main segments: drilling; construction; design and engineering; maintenance and expertise; and geophysical services. Typically, the drilling segment was the largest; however, in 2015, the volume of construction was larger than drilling due to a pipe replacement project at the Kashagan oil field and the future expansion of Tengiz field (KazService 2016). Kazakhstani companies are widely represented in less technologically advanced segments, particularly, in construction, maintenance and (vertical) drilling operations. Generally, the more complex the activity, the higher the share of foreign companies in the market. For instance, the share of Kazakhstani companies in the market of geological and geophysical services is only 28 percent (Figure 25). Although they have potential to do so, local companies are not sufficiently represented in the domestic market. Leading Kazakhstani service companies have demonstrated their international competitiveness by successfully operating in regional markets of Russia, Turkmenistan, China and India. 8Figure 24.

Local Companies’ Capacity Source: NAC 27 5.2. Upgrading Opportunities There are many potential pathways to economic upgrading, which in the GVC framework means that firms, countries or regions move to higher value activities in order to increase the benefits (profits, security, capabilities) from participating in global production (GVC Primer 2016). Comparing the upgrading trajectories of various oil-producing countries is crucial for identifying strategies that Kazakhstan can employ to advance along the oil and gas value chain. Table 4 provides some examples of upgrading strategies in the oil and gas industry. Upgrading Paths Description Entry into the VC Hydrocarbon-rich countries typically enter the chain with the start of oil and gas ex - traction. To enter the chain, the country does not need highly developed technologies or skills. It can provide the right to operate field to IOCs or participate in production through its agent, NOC, retaining some control over activity. Example. Middle Eastern OPEC countries entered the chain when IOCs started extract - ing oil in the region. In 1960s, upon gaining independence, these countries established NOCs and started upgrading within the chain. Process Upgrading Process upgrading is required to increase efficiency of production, which, for instance, in the upstream segment, maximizes extraction rates. It should be noted that, in commodity value chains, process upgrading is the most common type of modernization. Example. Within the production stage of the oil and gas value chain, maintenance activ - ities help sustain high volumes of production. They involve water or gas lift, water flood, injections of carbon dioxide, steam, miscible solvents or surfactants into reservoirs. Hydraulic fracturing, for instance, is one of maintenance activities. Evolution of fracking allowed to significantly reduce the cost of shale oil and gas production in the U.S. Product Upgrading Product upgrading can take place within downstream segments of the chain, when a firm diversifies from basic gasoline and diesel fuel to more complex products, e.g. petro - chemicals. Example. The Netherlands started participating in the chain with the discovery of large gas reserves, and then used the country’s favorable geographic location to establish a refining industry at its sea ports. Today, the country imports oil and gas from Russia, Norway and the Middle East (mainly LNG from Qatar); produces oil products; re-gas - ifies w LNG; and then exports a wide range of oil products, as well as gas and LNG to European markets. Table 4. Upgrading Trajectories in the Oil and Gas GVC Figure 25. The Footprint of Local Companies Source: KazService Association 28 Source: NAC One of the obvious pathways of upgrading would be to boost refining in Kazakhstan. Yet, the key feature of upgrading within GVC is the realization of export potential. Upgrading in the refining segment is already underway within the framework of the refining modernization program. After completion of the program, the three refineries’ production will cover domestic demand and Kazakhstan may become net exporter in 2018. Given the plans of neighboring oil producers— Russia, China, Azerbaijan and Iran—to increase their refining capacities and thus cover regional demand in Central Asia and Afghanistan, Kazakhstan has limited chances to find export markets for its oil-based products (Petromarket Research Group 2016). 5.3. Local Capability Development There are a number of reasons behind Kazakhstani firms’ position relative to foreign oil-field"}

First, oil companies typically operate within tightly coordinated networks of technologically sophisticated and financially powerful suppliers with a global reach. Therefore, they provide few opportunities for local participation, particularly in developing countries. Procurement processes of IOCs are often driven by these pre-existing networks and lack transparency. Historically, this has often limited the role of local firms to non-tradable and lower value operations. Over the past decade, procurement operations have become even more global, while modular development has resulted in previously nontraded services such as construction and fabrication being relocated to the most cost-efficient locations. This has further contributed to a decline in local participation. Today, new fields are developed by engineering firms based in key centers around the world, with little knowledge of local firms or their capabilities. Project requirements are defined by global standards, Upgrading Paths Description Functional Upgrading Functional upgrading in the oil and gas industry usually means moving from extraction and sell - ing of crude oil and gas to midstream and downstream activities—storage and transportation, refining, marketing and distribution. Example. After entering the industry, Norway used local content policies to stimulate IOCs to establish R&D centers and the development of a sophisticated service industry. Vertical integration is another example of functional upgrading by developing backward and forward linkages. The oil and gas industry is risky because of its capital intensity, price volatili - ty and probability of finding commercial reserves. Therefore, vertical integration of production segments within one company allows the realization of economies of scope and mitigating risks that emerge along the production chain. Chain Upgrading Chain upgrading means using the experience from operating in oil and gas sector GVC to an - other industry. A supplier, through backward linkages, could diversify its activity from servicing oil and gas companies to servicing other mining industries. Examples. Suppliers in Chile moved from providing services to the copper industry to support - ing the needs of the manufacturing industries. Geographic End Market Upgrading Geographic end-market upgrading means entering new markets, or diversifying export routes. Example. Due to gas liquifaction technology, Qatar started supplying LNG to Europe’s high - er-value end market through Rotterdam. This is an example of both process and geographic market upgrading. 29 rather than those of the production sites, and suppliers must be certified to even prequalify for bidding. However, many local firms are not even aware of these standards, immediately excluding them from procurement processes. Second, local companies often lack the required capacity. Kazakhstan, among many other countries, pushed IOCs to source locally. The country has undertaken a quantitative approach to local content requirements, setting in 2014 percentage targets of goods, works and services purchased by oil and gas producers in the country. The law obligated oil and gas companies to source locally 72.5 percent of works (i.e. operational activities) and services (i.e. consulting) jointly, whereas percentage share of goods (e.g. equipment, etc.) had to be at least 16 percent. This legislation was subsequently complemented by voluntary agreements on local spending for projects operating under production sharing agreements, initially exempt from requirements. Despite these measures, utilization of local content remains far below the target, reaching 54 percent in 2014. While this was up from 45 percent in 2010 (KAZENERGY, 2015), by unpacking these outcomes further, it becomes clear that a significant portion of this spending is generated through KMG, which reported 72 percent local content procurement in 2014 and sourced primarily from its own subsidiaries. Meanwhile, independent service firms highlight that they are struggling to remain competitive, while buyers say that they cannot find capable local firms to hire (Field Research, 2016). Third, the operating environment for Kazakhstani companies is challenging. The challenges include, for instance, limited access to finance, exacerbated by exchange rate fluctuations. Having to import equipment and pay loans in local currency, Kazakh suppliers find themselves in a disadvantaged position compared to foreign competitors. Many local companies are excluded from the largest projects of international oil companies because they are unable to provide sufficient financial guarantees from local banks. Fourth, the fundamental challenge of lack of qualified human capital with business as well as technical skills underlies the failure to meet safety, quality and technical standards requirements of international oil companies. For example, Kazakhstani companies with required technical capabilities are often barred at the prequalification stage due to lack of knowledge and/or attention to the adequate completion of applications in accordance with international oil companies’ requirements. One production company we interviewed mentioned delays in project expansion because the company could not find enough workers with required technical specialization in the market (Field Research, 2016). One hundred percent of interviewees highlighted the poor quality of the education system in Kazakhstan . Only a few schools and colleges deliver world-class outcomes in terms of the quality of graduates. For a number of reasons—including poor teaching standards, professor qualifications, inadequate curricula and lack of opportunities for industrial placement—a majority of education institutes fail to serve the needs of the industry, resulting in low job placement among Kazakhstani graduates. According to a study by the Ministry of Labor’s Analytical Center the job placement rates for the 2,000 to 3,000 annual graduates of petroleum-related degree programs was just 7 percent in 2014, and new graduates accounted for just 3.1 percent of the workforce (Information Analytical Center, 2016). There are few opportunities for ongoing training and education after graduation . Education 11 There are currently three systems: contractors operating under PSA regime (own closed system), a group of KMG companies (Samruk-Kazyna procurement system) and private companies (operate within NADLoc’s system). 30 of the workforce remains the purview of companies, and there are little incentives to invest in training for private actors. As a rule, large companies have training programs within their networks for professional qualification enhancement and within the Kazakh education system for basic skills training, such as English or safety training, or customized training. Smaller local companies have fewer resources to reach a comparable level of workforce development, thus exacerbating their competitive disadvantage."}

These include the introduction of e-procurement process, and efforts by the government through industry associations (KazService, KAZENERGY and PSA LLP) and the country’s largest operators (TCO, KPO) to promote joint ventures and provide insights into market demand. Kazakhstan introduced an e-procurement system in 2013 with a goal to reduce information asymmetry, thereby ensuring local firms are informed of potential opportunities and compete in tender process. However, the effort is undermined by the existence of separate rules and e-procurement systems for different groups of oil producers,11 resulting in market fragmentation that adds up to administrative costs of potential bidders. Besides, Kazakhstan’s education system fails to address specific industry needs and increase its flexibility to react to demand changes. Unlike many other oil-producing countries, Kazakhstan lacks a coherent human development strategy. Local and foreign firms maintain that there is an acute shortage of qualified labor for key occupations; the quality of graduates is poor; and there are few opportunities or incentives for ongoing skills development. 6. Lessons From Other Countries 6.1. Human Capital This section investigates best international practices of oil and gas exporters, which have successfully overcome the human capital development challenge by engaging all stakeholders instead of placing emphasis on the education system alone. In our view, one of the limitations to human capital development in Kazakhstan has been the lack of coordination and lack of responsiveness of the education system to the industry needs. Therefore, the optimal path forward is to create a workforce with industry-relevant skills through a participatory approach with industry, government and education. There are several key features of a top performing workforce development system: A) a coherent workforce development strategy put together by all relevant stakeholders; B) a demand-driven approach in response to industry needs at both the technical and professional levels; C) high- quality teaching staff; D) curriculum adherence to evolving dynamics of the global industry; and E) an emphasis on practical experience for an optimal education. Many oil-producing countries—the U.S., U.K., Australia—establish a specific industry strategy for the development of human capital in which all important stakeholders are involved . For example, in Alaska , the industry launched a five-year workforce development strategy for 2014-18. The plan was jointly developed by two committees, an industry steering committee with 11 representatives from the private sector, and a technical and education committee, comprised of representatives of the educational institutions at the university and TVET levels, labor unions, as well as key governmental departments: Labor, Education and the 31 Commerce, Community and Economic Development (Alaska Workforce Development Plan 2014). Western Australia prepares a similar workforce development strategy for its resources sector, including specific details on how the plan is to be implemented. The U.K. has also developed a workforce development strategy, mainly focused on talent retention and the identification of skills gaps, particularly at the TVET level (UK Government 2016). These strategies include an analysis of industry trends and the country’s industry development plans, detail job profiles, talent retention approaches, and an examination of the educational system’s capacity to supply the right skills for both the short and long term. Due to information gaps, establishing an effective strategy requires the engagement of multiple stakeholders. Yet this can be challenging since formal communication channels between private sector and educational institutions (public and private) are often weak or nonexistent in many developing countries. Examples from developed countries show that educational institutions are generally more successful when they have a high degree of interaction with industry stakeholders. This interaction can take place between both formal and informal communication channels, with the government playing the role of facilitator to bring together the various actors. Successful strategies are developed using a demand-driven approach; that is, developing human capital supply in response to the demands of industry for specific skills . Availability of qualified labor and agility of the workforce development become a competitive advantage. Participation in different stages of the oil and gas GVC requires different sets of skills; thus, it is critical to develop feedback mechanisms with industry to ensure the skills being taught at any one time are those appropriate for the current stage of the value chain, and not just the industry in general. One widely used mechanism to ensure that demand for workforce meets adequate response is an industry-specific labor market survey. The U.S. Department of Labor carries out an annual Occupational Employment Survey, from which it derives highly detailed information on current and projected employment numbers for a large range of job profiles in the industry, earnings by occupations, typical entry-level education, experience and on-the-job training requirements, and occupational health and safety concerns. This data is available publicly and is also linked to an online resource O*NET, which provides even further information about daily tasks of each position (O*NET OnLine 2016). The U.K. provides a similar site (www.myoilandgascareer.com) to orient job seekers toward high-demand roles. In North Carolina (U.S.) the community-college system uses this data-driven approach to ensure it is highly responsive to local business’ requirements to shape its supply of training tools and education profiles according to the most up-to-date industrial needs (Little 2016). Another instrument for directing students toward high-demand positions is to provide scholarships only for high-demand careers, and not those where supply already outstrips demand. This approach is also being used in the U.K. to drive entry into engineering degrees where there is an annual deficit of approximately 55,000 engineers. The U.K. provides scholarships of up to US $53,000 per student pursuing these degrees (LaunchpadRecruits 2016). Quality of the teaching staff is considered to be a critical element by both industry and educational institutions . In an industry such as oil and gas, practical industry experience is fundamental for teachers to adequately prepare students to enter the workforce. This is important to ensure that the knowledge and skills of students is linked to the reality of the workplace, from applicable theories to the application of new technologies. In"}

For example, leading universities such as Texas A&M (Texas, U.S.) worked with oil and gas companies during the peak of the boom to allow experienced workers to take a “sabbatical” to teach for one to two years before returning to their jobs 32 (Holeywell 2014). At the TVET level, industry professionals teach in local community colleges; for instance, in North Carolina’s community colleges, established practitioners teach classes at least two times a week. The reason why community-college education in North Carolina has been a success lies in the close cooperation of private sector, local authorities and management of the education institutions. For example, the Advisory Board of the community-college system consists of industry professionals, among other stakeholders (Little 2016). Part of the challenge of retaining high-quality teaching staff is the cost for educational institutions, particularly during periods of high demand. Yet, when industry is engaged in a constructive dialogue, it can understand the longer-term benefits of maintaining teaching staff in place. For example, to help meet the needs of the sector in Russia , BP established a long-running program in which they sponsored professors for up to US $100,000 at leading Russian universities (ILO 2012). In the current downturn, other schools have been able to tap into the experienced staff members that are currently retiring from industry. This is not uncommon in Kazakhstan ; staff at Caspian Social University (Almaty, Kazakhstan) noted that due to extreme work conditions in the fields, industry professionals retire early and move to more comfortable living locations, where they can utilize their expertise—in education, among other options (Field Research, 2016). The curriculum changes to meet the evolving needs of the global industry. The extractive sector is characterized by rapidly evolving technologies and is dominated by international companies that maintain strict standards with respect to technical protocols, safety and environmental impact. In order to graduate job-ready workers, educational institutions must keep up with these requirements. Numerous developing countries have thus adopted international curricula to secure employment for local workers. For example, in the early 2010s, Saudi Arabia launched a massive project to establish local training programs at the TVET level based on international standards, with two new schools, Saudi Petroleum Services Polytechnic (SPSP, a partnership with Saudi Arabia Chevron) and the National Industrial Training Institute (NITI). SPSP offers a two-year technical program with courses in English, employability skills, and 33 health and safety among others; the curriculum is accredited by the U.K.’s City & Guild and the International Association of Drilling Contractors. The government also contracted globally recognized Petrofac Training Services to operate and contract a to-scale drilling training center (Andrews and Playfoot 2015). Likewise, BP contracted Petrofac together with Russian-based TTI International to establish a training school in Baku, Azerbaijan, to supply their needs for the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli oil field and Shah Deniz gas fields. Graduates also receive City & Guild Level 2 accreditation (Petrofac 2016). In Australia , petroleum engineers must be registered with the Society for Petroleum Engineers (SPE) in order to work in the industry. SPE Australia works with the International Society for Petroleum Engineers to ensure that only graduates who meet international standards can register (Engineers Australia 2016). An optimal education for the industry must entail practical experience. This includes apprenticeship programs, internships and “real-model” training facilities. Several countries around the world have adopted programs in which practical experience is an essential part of education for the industry, with specific qualifications attached. The different approaches taken vary by length, organization and incentives, etc. Saudi Arabia’s NITI requires a six- to 12-month job placement; Norway’s apprenticeship program is for 12 months; while the U.K. requires a full two years for its apprenticeships. In terms of organization, Norway and the U.K. apprenticeships for the industry are managed nationally through centralized offices that coordinate directly with firms to place students and ensure that firms dedicate sufficient time and qualified personnel to work with the apprentices (Andrews and Playfoot 2015). Statoil, Norway’s oil and gas company, leads by example in this area and is the largest apprenticeship company in the country, thus encouraging other firms to follow suit (Statoil 2016). In addition, in some countries, these apprenticeships are incentivized by government through subsidies. Nova Scotia, Canada, offers a wage subsidy for employers hiring students and new graduates from Nova Scotia universities and community colleges (Nova Scotia Department of Energy 2016). Malaysia offers a double tax deduction incentive for related expenses incurred during its internship programs (TalentCorp Malaysia). Norway provides firms with a subsidy of approximately US $12,000 per apprentice per year to encourage firms to take on more students (Andrews and Playfoot 2015). An alternative model includes one in which the state, together with educational institutions, establishes true-to-scale training facilities to provide this hands-on experience. Singapore’s Economic Development Board, for example, established the Chemicals Process Technology Center with Nayang Polytechnic to provide pre-employment training for 800 students per year for petrochemical operations. They also open the facilities for up to 8,000 employees of the petrochemical sector to receive additional instruction (Carpenter and Kiong Ng 2013). Saudi Arabia has followed this example with the development of the Dhahran Training Center with full-scale operations for training drillers for the sector (Arabian Drilling Company 2016). 6.2. Local Content The analysis of the oil and gas value chain revealed a tiered production system with captive governance relationships between lead firms and suppliers. This type of governance implies that production chains are fairly closed and large corporations exercise a strong influence over the supply chain. To increase positive spillovers from oil and gas production on their territory, host countries introduce various policies to increase local content in the operations of oil and gas companies. Approaches to local content development also vary, from fixing regulatory targets and obligations to setting flexible action “vector” with no exact measurement of “local” inputs or outputs. This part of"}

Russia and Kazakhstan set LCR targets for goods and services that must be procured locally, and they set goals on local workforce participation. Australia and Canada use a flexible approach, where oil companies are required to attract local suppliers without hard percentage targets. The appropriate LCR approach is conditioned on local capabilities. Firms in developing counties often lack technical expertise or experience to engage with foreign partners in sophisticated operations. However, in developing countries, there is a clear need to increase returns and improve the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of extractive industries. The recent downturn in the oil industry and Kazakhstan’s accession to the WTO in 2015 has changed the environment for the country. Now, it has to compete for investors and prepare local firms for more competition with foreign companies before the end of the transition period in 2022. Besides, Kazakhstan is developing a new Subsoil Code to be introduced in 2018. Thus, it is appropriate to evaluate policy results and to adjust the approach to LCR now, when the country and the industry are undergoing an important policy and market shift. Despite having a range of policies, Kazakhstan has had limited success in promoting local participation in the global oil and gas value chain . Some of the reasons behind low efficacy of policies are a decentralized approach toward improving local suppliers’ competitiveness, poor coordination among stakeholders, and inconsistency and lack of focus on long-term outcomes and objectives. Kazakhstan needs to improve upon policies already in place and consider implementing proven set of actions. The following section discusses international best practices that have been successful in creating an enabling environment for local supplier development. According to the best practices, a core element of LCRs is fair and full opportunities for local firms to participate in the procurement process on a competitive basis . This requires oil firms and operators to increase the visibility of their procurement needs and practices by submitting detailed production and development plans. For example: Australian Industry Participation plan (AIP) and Benefit Plan in Nova Scotia. Those plans require firms to submit detailed plans on how they intend to identify local firms to participate in the procurement process, including the distribution of information in a timely manner to local suppliers (World Bank, 2013). In Australia, foreign firms are encouraged to include local firms in their global supply chains. In Canada, firms have to provide a detailed assessment of potential of local firms to do the job required (Kean, 2016). This requirement flows down to all contractors and subcontractors, for which the lead firm is held accountable. The plan must be approved before work authorization may be granted (Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board, 2011). Russia implements a strict regulatory approach to local content development. Yet, in addition to having government set percentage targets on local labor, goods and works, Russian companies strive to create competitive a local supplier base. For example, Sakhalin Energy Investment Company actively implemented a Russian supplier development program aimed at promoting development opportunities of the Russian business and to increase its participation in the project “Sakhalin-2.” An important component of the program is an educational module that includes trainings on health, safety, quality management system, skills to participate in the company’s tenders and workshops with foreign companies. The program also includes measures to support Russian companies to ensure the passage of technical skills that help to approve suppliers “Sakhalin Energy,” included in the list. In 2015, they conducted 15 seminars for 238 specialists from 99 companies. Moreover, they expended the number of possible suppliers through special 35 assessment with certification (Sakhalin Energy 2016). To provide equal conditions for local and external suppliers, it is crucial to reduce information asymmetry to ensure that local firms have a fair opportunity to express interest in bids . Foreign companies are obligated to inform local firms about upcoming tenders in an effective and nondiscriminatory way (usually through a website). For instance, Russia’s “Shtokman Development AG” (SDAG) develops gas and condensate fields in the Barents Sea with France’s Total and Norway’s Statoil. To ensure participation of local firms, SDAG created a database of potential Russian contractors and suppliers. It is a unified, updatable source of information about Russian oil and gas enterprises and service companies and a list of services, equipment and components they provide. In addition, SDAG commits to fully and openly inform companies about its plans and action related to Russian content activities and provide clarifications whenever required. To provide relevant information on local suppliers’ capabilities, governments, associations or private firms often create a special web platform, which displays updated information and serves as a catalog . Australia’s Industry Capabilities Network is probably the most sophisticated example of the supplier guide; and the online resource ( www.icn.org.au ) helps to set linkages between suppliers and operators. It serves as a marketplace where operators can publish their procurement plans and suppliers can adequately display their skills and competences. In addition, the Buy Australia at Home and Abroad Program (2010) funds Supplier Advocates and a Supplier Advisory Forum to boost linkages between suppliers and major projects in the sector (I. Department of Industry, and Science, 2016). Nova Scotia’s Department of Energy actively works with local industry associations to gather information about local firm capabilities, reaches out to new investors early to discuss their procurement needs and facilitates introductions to local firms and their facilities with site tours (Kean, 2016). Furthermore, they require that firms open a local procurement office with the necessary levels of authorization and staff for sourcing (Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board, 2011; Department of Industry Innovation, 2013). There is an analog of such a website in Kazakhstan named “Alash,” launched in 2016"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_Oil-Gas-GVC-Kazakhstan-Report-2017_18", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\Oil-Gas-GVC-Kazakhstan-Report-2017.pdf", "text": "by the Ministry of Energy (KazService, January-March 2016). The database was created to eliminate market fragmentation and information asymmetry. Currently, there are three “procurement groups”: the national company KMG and its subsidiaries, participants of product sharing agreement (PSA), and small local firms. It is virtually impossible for small and medium local firms to break into supply chains of KMG or PSA due to the pre-existing network of preferred suppliers for both types of buyers. It is too early to assess the effectiveness of Alash; however, it is important to provide high transparency and nondiscrimination in the functioning of the database, the bidding process and other procurement operations. All of the above must be followed by a local supplier development program and a measurement system to strengthen the industry’s research and development (R&D) ecosystem . Nova Scotia, for example, uses the highest “Work Expenditure Bid”—including not just operational aspects, but also planned investments in employment and training and R&D— as the principal criterion for decision-making for license awards (Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board, 2012). Gorgon (Australia), a joint project led by Chevron (47 percent), ExxonMobil (25 percent) and Shell (25 percent), has had a very positive impact on the local economy and suppliers. The joint project developed a training facility for employees, engineers and technical staff in Western Australia to house four training programs. Since the beginning of the project, more than US $45B has been spent, resulting in more than 900 local contractors, and 19,000 workers, directly employed. Joint ventures and private supplier development investments have become an effective vehicle for 36 knowledge, skills and technology transfer. In Nova Scotia, the estimated cumulative value of the technology transfer associated with the Sable Project since 1998 exceeds US $32 million (2015 Sable Project Canada - Nova Scotia Benefits Report, 2016). Besides, in Nova Scotia, several agencies, including Export Development Canada and Nova Scotia Business Inc. (NSBI) provide options such as access to low-cost finance by providing loan guarantees (Export Development Canada, 2016; Kean, 2016; NSBI, 2016). NSBI, together with the Department of Energy, teaches local firms to navigate significant administrative challenges related to participation in global oil and gas supply chain, covering a range of processes from simple ones to how to complete required paperwork to obtain required certifications to work in the industry (Kean, 2016; NSBI, 2016). Nova Scotia also requires that a certain percentage of either profits or production cost operations be directed to local R&D expenditure, with the goal to create export oriented technologies and capabilities (Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board, 2011). The province requires firms to educate and train local staff and prepare a development plan indicating how local employees will be groomed for higher professional levels as the project advances (Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board, 2011; Center for Energy Economics; Kean, 2016). The Australian government, together with universities and industry, establishes sectorial Centers of Excellence in key locations. In addition, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization undertakes continued research with industry players and other universities, such as the Subsea Pipelines Collaboration Cluster, which has launched its new technologies in oil fields around the world, as well as producing some 40 Ph.Ds. (Government of Australia). To ensure integration of small local suppliers into the GVC and their subsequent upgrading, it is crucial to run an export support program . The Australian approach recognizes the need to quickly insert local firms into operations abroad (Australian Industry Participation in Major Infrastructure Projects, 1997; World Bank, 2013). The Buy Australian at Home and Abroad program allocated some US $3 million over four years to help create access for Australian suppliers in the resources sector, both domestically and in foreign projects (ICN, 2016). Austrade also actively promotes Australian firms abroad, using instruments such as Industry Capabilities Reports to share with prospective buyers. In Canada, an export credit agency—self-financing, Crown corporation operates at arm’s length 37 from the government—provides loans for SMEs, insurance and education in the field of international trade. For example, in 2015, they facilitated US $104.2B., where US $22.7B was allocated for extractive industry (EDC 2015). In 2007, Kazakhstan created an export promotion agency, named KAZNEX INVEST. As an export promotion agency, KAZNEX INVEST conducts trade missions, participates in exhibitions, covers marketing expenses in foreign countries, and conducts seminars for exporters and firms that are willing to export and to make export market overviews. However, the agency has been working with exporters of goods, not services. As international trade in services grows, it is a logical step to extend support to high- value service exporters too. 6.3. Policy Recommendations Human Capital Kazakhstan is a newcomer in the oil and gas sector, and it has the opportunity to take advantage of the best practices developed by countries with decades of experience in the industry. Countries with a mature industry understand the cyclical nature of the sector, and that a downturn such as today’s will eventually shift direction. They take advantage of downturns to prepare their human capital to be ready for the next wave of industry development. Likewise, Kazakhstan should take this opportunity to develop its workforce and catch up with the required skills of the leading companies on the field. One of the pathways to upgrading would be adaptation of a participatory approach to the development of education system . In Kazakhstan, establishment of a comprehensive workforce development strategy could mitigate the challenges in the area of human capital. This midterm strategy of human capital development, first and foremost, should be developed in close collaboration with oil and gas operators, oil-field service companies, education institutions (both higher education and TVET), the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labor . There are several essential elements to the strategy: • An industry overview with detailed information on the existing workforce and its composition in Kazakhstan’s oil and gas and oil-field industries. In particular, this section of analysis may contain the number of graduates by occupation over the past five years. The analysis should cover current labor"}
{"chunk_id": "analytics_en_Oil-Gas-GVC-Kazakhstan-Report-2017_19", "category": "analytics", "language": "en", "source": "data\\analytics\\en\\Oil-Gas-GVC-Kazakhstan-Report-2017.pdf", "text": "requirements, detailed job profiles, and average wage by occupation. • Provide a detailed employment forecast as an important part of the strategy that should be published and available online as an up-to-date database. The Ministry of Labor, which already produces regional employment forecasts, could administer these industry specific analysis and forecasts based on industry surveys. • Making the information available to all interested parties is important for closing the gap between industry needs and the education system. Creation of an industry specific website with the current and forecast information on careers in the oil and gas industry containing the description of skills required, priority occupations, earnings and employment outlook (which can be fairly general, such as “weak, moderate, strong,”) will allow the supply side (i.e. high school graduates, students, workers and education institutions) to make informed decisions regarding their professional paths, master their qualification and adjust curricula accordingly . • Identification of industry trends in all segments of the value chain, domestically and internationally , will help universities and colleges tailor their study programs and eventually raise 38 12 This practice called Advanced Learner Loans works in the U.K. https://www.gov.uk/guidance/24-advanced- learning-loans-an-overview the quality of teaching. Overall, it will align positions of state bodies and private sector, and their vision of the future of the industry; thus, Kazakhstan can improve responsiveness of policies to the market needs. This section can be developed by the professional associations and industry experts. • The core of the strategy will review the education system for oil and gas. The review will evaluate by education levels—university, TVET and professional training opportunities—relevant institutions and their potential (for instance, staff, technical base) and professional occupations taught in the institutions. Another indispensable element is the review of polices and incentives in attaining education or certain skills enhancement (grants, scholarships, tax credits) provided by the government and the private sector. • The workforce development strategy should entail a lifelong approach to education. A part of the program shall be dedicated to the review of existing opportunities for career enhancement, which so far have largely remained in the purview of individual companies. • The concluding section of the program will contain policy actions and stakeholder collaboration schemes (e.g. quarterly meetings, conferences, industrial placement programs, attracting professionals to teach in colleges and universities, etc.). The latter can be organized in following the example of North Carolina community colleges, where industry professionals come to teach a few hours a week to a local college as part of their community service. In Kazakhstan, this practice can be tied to work permits for foreign workers who can transfer their rich experience to Kazakhstani co-workers and students, or it can incentivize in other ways. Another mechanism to attract students to TVET is provision of student loans that workers start repaying later in their careers, when their salaries reach a certain level12) and other measures to develop high-quality labor force for oil and gas and oil-field service industries in Kazakhstan. The role of government in leading these efforts to improve the quality of human capital and building strong linkages between industry and the education system cannot be underestimated . Government bodies will have to gather information regarding industry trends and plans, priority occupations and the demand for labor, and, more importantly, effectively disseminate that information. Thus, a government-run website, providing the results of the industry and Ministry of Energy surveys, will be a central tool to effectively boost the workforce development strategy. In developing and implementing this type of program, it is crucial to make the measurement, monitoring, evaluation and program revision an ongoing effort . Stakeholders should adopt an evidence-based approach to policymaking and implementation processes. To ensure a flexible yet transparent strategy, industry associations such as the energy producers’ association KAZENERGY and the service providers’ association KazService can take lead in its development, implementation and monitoring, with participation of all stakeholders. Success of such strategy may create a precedent for other key industries, for instance, agribusiness or mining sector, to follow suit. The Government should encourage replication of the most successful practices. 39 Local Participation All countries that have successfully implemented local supplier development policies and managed to break into closed circle of supply chain in the industry have focused on fostering competitiveness of local firms both at home and abroad . Clarity of the institutional and legal framework is an important condition of the ultimate LCR success. A potential pathway to upgrade the oil industry of Kazakhstan is to develop an adjacent oil-field service sector, which picked up in 2000s but currently finds itself in a situation of high uncertainty and distress. Local content development is a suitable approach to enhance the local supplier base, but the policy should be altered to meet the new challenges of the industry. There are a few steps that Kazakhstan can take, drawing upon lessons from other countries: • First, there should be a coherent policy and institutional framework to promote upgrading in a systemic manner and supplement existing targets. Kazakhstan may develop a comprehensive development strategy for the oil-field service industry; and a designated private or a joint government/private agency can oversee the execution of the strategy. • The strategy should contain the following components: capability development tools, including trainings (for instance, in administrative issues or business development); access to cheap credit for service companies, especially SMEs; tools or subsidies to support getting international certification ; R&D support (e.g. establishment of R&D centers, preferably with participation of local universities); technology transfer mechanisms (joint ventures, cooperative research, etc.); market research at home and abroad to map local suppliers’ capabilities and opportunities in the global market; and export support . It should be noted that the government’s role and government financing are crucial, in particular for R&D development and matchmaking of foreign oil and gas companies and relevant local firms that should follow from the research efforts. • Second, the oil-field industry should be liberalized. Bloated structure of the state- owned KMG and its inflexibility not only places a"}

Instead of subsidizing inefficient producers and service providers for a long period of industry downturn, Kazakhstan can increase sector agility while ensuring talent retention. For instance, after the privatization of numerous quasi-state service companies, Germany and Australia introduced short-term “unemployment” payments to the workers of idle companies. • Third, competition law should be rigorously applied to the oil and gas sector, particularly, in procurement and outsourcing in the industry. In Kazakhstan, procurement in the oil and gas sector is virtually exempt from the anti-trust regulation, and the practice of special treatment of state-owned companies and affiliated companies needs to be eliminated. 40 References Alaska Workforce Development Plan (2014).
