Сроки реализации 2025-2040 годы Раздел 2. Анализ текущей ситуации 2.1. Необходимость разработки Концепции В Стратегии \"Казахстан-2950' новый политический курс состоявшегося государства\" отмечается, что нефтегазовый комплекс Казахстана является локомотивом для всей экономики и способствует развитию других отраслей и, соответственно, одной из приоритетных задач к 2050 году является обеспечение энергетической безопасности страны. К энергетической и экономической безопасности страны относятся также стабильность и баланс производства, потребления и запасов на внутреннем рынке нефтепродуктов и, соответственно, 100 %-ное обеспечение внутреннего рынка и развитие экспорта в условиях растущих потребностей экономики в период 2025-2049 годов Стратегия достижения углеродной нейтральности Республики Казахстан до 2060 года предусматривает низкоуглеродное развитие за счет снижения выбросов парниковых газов (далее - выбросы) при использовании наиболее энергоэффективных технологий и материалов научно-исследовательские и опытно-конструкторские работы для перехода к углеродной нейтральности, создание новых рабочих мест. Также в Национальном плане развития Республики Казахстан до 2029 года отмечаются риски дефицита сырья НПЗ, низкие цены и, следовательно, ускоренные темпы потребления топлива и перетоки нефтепродуктов в соседние страны, необходимость расширения мощности хранения нефтепродуктов и реформы ценообразования для сбалансированного развития отрасли К настоящему времени Международным энергетическим агентством разработан, в том числе \"Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario” или сценарий \"Нулевые выбросы парниковых газов к 2050 году\", предполагающие активную реализацию принципов ESG.

Так, к развивающимся и имеющим стабильный спрос на нефтепродукты, а также географически близко расположенным к Казахстану относятся страны: Центральной Азии - Узбекистан (37 млн чел.), Таджикистан (19 млн чел.), Кыргызстан (7 млн чел.) и Туркменистан (6 млн чел.); Южной и Юго-Западной Азии - Пакистан (237 млн чел), Иран (87 млн чел.), Афганистан (43 млн чел.). Общая численность населения стран составляет до 430 млн чел. Предыдущий среднесрочный Комплексный план развития нефтеперерабатывающих заводов (далее - НПЗ) на 2009 - 2015 годы предусматривал реконструкцию и модернизацию мощностей Атырауского, Павлодарского и Шымкентского НПЗ с 14 до 17 млн тонн в год для внутреннего рынка. Данный план не предусматривал необходимость долгосрочного развития нефтеперерабатывающей отрасли Казахстана с учетом новых региональных и мировых вызовов, в том числе: расширение нефтеперерабатывающих мощностей в связи с растущими потребностями экономики; переход на увеличенный межремонтный период и снижение аварийности; увеличение глубины переработки нефти выше 89 %; развитие экспорта нефтепродуктов на рынки Центральной, Южной и Юго-Западной Азии повышение вклада в Е5б-повестку, прикладную науку и базовую нефтехимию; повышение вклада в валовый внутренний продукт (далее - ВВП) страны. Так, в 2009 году при принятии решения по разработке технико-экономического обоснования (далее - ТЭ0) модернизации и реконструкции Атырауского, Павлодарского и Шымкентского НПЗ суммарной мощностью 17 млн тонн/год население Казахстана составляло 16 млн человек. На сегодня численность населения Казахстана составляет 20 млн человек и продолжает увеличиваться. Таким образом, назрела необходимость разработки отдельного и долгосрочного документа - Концепции развития нефтеперерабатывающей отрасли на 2025 - 2040 годы (далее - Концепция). Разработка Концепции инициирована Министерством энергетики Республики Казахстан, являющимся центральным исполнительным органом Республики Казахстан и осуществляющим формирование и реализацию государственной политики, координацию в процессе управления, в том числе в сфере государственного регулирования производства нефтепродуктов, в соответствии с постановлением Правительства Республики Казахстан от 19 сентября 2914 года № 994. Разработка документа выполнена Министерством энергетики Республики Казахстан (далее - Министерство) совместно с заинтересованными государственными органами и компаниями: Министерство экологии и природных ресурсов Республики Казахстан ассоциация \"KAZENERGY\", акционерное общество \"Самрук-Казына\" (далее - Фонд), акционерное общество \"Национальная компания \"КазМунайГаз\" (далее - КМГ), товарищество с ограниченной ответственностью \"Атырауский нефтеперерабатывающий завод\", товарищество с ограниченной ответственностью \"Павлодарский нефтехимический завод\", товарищество с ограниченной ответственностью \"ПетроКазахстан Ойл Продактс\", товарищество с ограниченной ответственностью \"Совместное предприятие “CaspiBitum\" (далее - CaspiBitum) и акционерное общество \"Институт топлива, катализа и электрохимии имени Д.В. Сокольского\", являющегося одним из специализированных научно- исследовательских институтов в сфере нефтепереработки и нефтехимии. Концепция содержит анализ текущей ситуации, обзор международного опыта и видение развития отрасли, определяет основные подходы, принципы и целевые индикаторы по устойчивому развитию нефтеперерабатывающей отрасли Республики Казахстан в период 2025 - 2040 годов с учетом региональных и мировых вызовов по основным направлениям: Обеспечение экономики отечественными нефтепродуктами. Экспорт отечественных нефтепродуктов. ESG, развитие прикладной науки и базовой нефтехимии. Повышение вклада в ВВП страны. Усовершенствование государственной политики в отрасли, увеличение кадрового потенциала и соответствие мировым трендам. Отмечается, что реализация Концепции направлена также на соответствие 4-х из 17 целей устойчивого развития Организации Объединенных Наций или № № 8, 9, 12, 13: экономический рост и занятость, индустриализация"}

Конечной целью Концепции является обеспечение конкурентоспособности казахстанских НПЗ за счет устойчивого и опережающего развития, привлечения инвестиций и концентрации ресурсов в ответ на современные региональные и глобальные вызовы. Ниже приводится краткая характеристика казахстанских НПЗ. Нефтеперерабатывающая отрасль Казахстана представлена крупными НПЗ, в том числе Атырауский НПЗ (далее - АНПЗ) Ввод завода в эксплуатацию произведен в 1945 году, профиль НПЗ - топливно-нефтехимическая схема с глубокой переработкой 5,5 млн тонн/год Мангистауской нефти, индекс Нельсона - 13,9, глубина переработки - до 89 %. Павлодарский НХЗ (далее - ПНХЗ) Ввод завода в эксплуатацию - 1978 год, профиль НПЗ - топливная схема с глубокой переработкой 5,5 млн тонн/год западносибирской нефти с содержанием серы до 1,6 % масс., индекс Нельсона - 19,5, глубина переработки нефти - 89 %. Нефтехимический завод чувствителен к содержанию серы в нефти, поставляемой в рамках Соглашения между правительствами Республики Казахстан и Российской Федерации о сотрудничестве в области транспортировки российской нефти Шымкентский НПЗ (далее - ШНПЗ) Ввод завода в эксплуатацию - 1985 год, профиль НПЗ - топливная схема с глубокой переработкой 6 млн тонн/год смеси кумкольской нефти, индекс Нельсона - 8,1, что подтверждает имеющийся потенциал дальнейшего развития. Достигнутый показатель глубины переработки кумкольской нефти - 98 % и выхода светлых нефтепродуктов - 82 %. Однако по мере истощения кумкольской группы месторождений и увеличения в сырье НПЗ до 27 % доли западно-казахстанской нефти снижаются глубина переработки до 82-86 % и выход светлых до 74,9-79 %. Проведенные в 2009-2018 годы модернизация и реконструкция Атырауского, Павлодарского и Шымкентского НПЗ приблизили их к уровню ведущих западных и российских предприятий с выработкой нефтепродуктов в соответствии с Техническим регламентом Таможенного союза ТР ТС №013/2011 \"О требованиях к автомобильному и авиационному бензину, дизельному и судовому топливу, топливу для реактивных двигателей и мазуту\", начиная с 1 января 2018 года (далее - ТР TC № 0913/2011). 2.2. Итоги модернизации НПЗ в 2010-2019 годы По итогам модернизации НПЗ достигнуты цели по повышению: индекса Нельсона или уровня технологичности АНПЗ с 4,8 до 13,9, ПНХЗ - с 7,2 до 10,5, ШНПЗ - с 4 до 8,1 при среднемировых значениях 8-10; мощностей нефтепереработки АНПЗ с 4,7 до 5,5, ПНХЗ - с 4,7 до 5,5, ШНПЗ - с 4,6 до 6 млн. тонн/год или суммарно - с 14 до 17 млн. тонн/год; качества моторных топлив с уровня экологического стандарта К-2 (аналог Euro-2) до уровня не ниже К4 (аналог Euro-4) в соответствии с ТР ТС № 0913/2011. Дополнительный эффект модернизации НПЗ заключался в повышении сводной глубины нефтепереработки НПЗ с 70,7 до 89 % и сводной выработки светлых нефтепродуктов с 53,3 до 72 %; числа новых объектов с 58 до 164 или в 2,8 раза, в том числе технологических - с 29 до 58 и вспомогательных - с 29 до 114, оборудования с 13 672 до 23 195 или в 1,7 раза при соотношении прежнего / нового оборудования - 609/40 % (АНПЗ - с 4 963 до 8 663, ПНХЗ - c 5 923 go 7 630, ШНПЗ - c 3 686 до 6 902).

В настоящее время действует завод “CaspiBitum\" в городе Актау по переработке 1 млн тонн/год каражанбасской нефти и производству 500 тыс. тонн/год дорожного битума. Присутствуют другие участники - производители битума товарищество с ограниченной ответственностью “QazaqBitum\" (далее -QazaqBitum) и товарищество с ограниченной ответственностью \"Асфальтобетон-1\" (далее - Асфальтобетон), работающие на импортном российском гудроне, акционерное общество \"Конденсат\" и мини-НПЗ, продукция которых не отвечает требованиям стандартов К4, К5 (деятельность подвержена различным факторам и отличается нестабильностью загрузки). В настоящее время внутренний рынок нефтепродуктов формируется исходя из потребностей в нефтепродуктах, которые растут опережающими производство темпами, в том числе за счет разницы цен на нефтепродукты с соседними странами, увеличения транзитного транспорта, сезонности спроса. В условиях повышенного спроса на рынке нефтепродуктов до 2040 года НПЗ осуществляют ключевую роль в энергетической безопасности страны. 2.3. Комплексный план реформирования системы производства и распределения горюче-смазочных материалов (далее - ГСМ) К настоящему времени Правительством Республики Казахстан реализован Комплексный план реформирования системы производства и распределения ГСМ на Атырауском, Павлодарском и Шымкентском НПЗ, включая: № п/п Реформа Выполнено 1 2 3 1 Контроль деятельности НПЗ Аудит Павлодарского, Атырауского и Шымкентского НПЗ, в том числе по причинам образования технологических топлив и потерь, систем безопасности и контроля производства, хранения, вывоза продукции и технологических процессов НПЗ, наличия заключений лицензиаров, специализированных компаний, экспертиз по технологическим процессам. 2 Плановые ремонты Своевременность ежегодных планово- предупредительных работ, в том числе проведение капитального ремонта 1 раз в 3 года.

Внеплановые остановки и аварийные ситуации на НПЗ В период 2920 - 2022 годов зафиксирован 391 внеплановый простой на трех НПЗ, в том числе 119 наиболее крупных из-за аварийных ситуаций, недостаточности мер по техническому обслуживанию и надзору оборудования. В 2023 году зафиксированы 33 внеплановые остановки, приведшие к необходимости корректировки выработки нефтепродуктов НПЗ и, следовательно, к социальному напряжению на рынке ГСМ. Основными причинами снижения уровня надежности оборудования являются переносы планово-предупредительных работ на НПЗ от 6 до 12 месяцев для обеспечения сезонной нехватки нефтепродуктов, недофинансирование на системной основе мер по техническому обслуживанию и надзору оборудования из-за низкой стоимости нефтепродуктов, нехватка квалифицированных кадров из-за перетоков на нефтегазовые проекты. 2.5.

Так, план увеличения производства дорожного битума 4-х заводов на 2023 год, подготовленный на основании прогноза потребления Министерства транспорта, составлял 1 211 тыс. тонн, в том числе: CaspiBitum - 500, ПНХЗ - 280, QazaqBitum - 360 и Асфальтобетон - 72. Вместе с тем 4 казахстанских завода за 2023 год произвели 849 из 1 211 тыс. тонн битума или 70 % от плана, в том числе \"CaspiBitum\" - 358 из 500 тыс. тонн или 72 %; \"ПНХЗ\" - 290 из 280 тыс. тонн или 104 %; \"QazaqBitum\" - 119 из 360 тыс. тонн или 33 %; \"Асфальтобетон\" - 82 из 72 тыс. тонн или 114 %. Производительность крупнейшего в Центральной Азии битумного завода CaspiBitum составила не более @,9 из 1,6 тыс. тонн/сут. битума или 56 % до середины мая, т.е. в пик строительно-дорожных работ. Причинами, влияющими на снижение производства битума, являются: задержка заявок и оплат для отгрузки битума дорожно-строительными компаниями (далее - ДСК); первоочередная выборка ДСК российского битума по более привлекательным ценам - 66 - 129 тыс. тенге/тонн при цене казахстанского битума 93,7 - 138 тыс. тенге/тонна без налога на добавленную стоимость на условиях \"free carrier\"; конвенционные запреты на пограничном переходе \"Канисай\" и, соответственно, недопоставка гудрона - сырья QazaqBitum и Асфальтобетон. Аналогичная ситуация по производству битума сложилась в 2024 году (произведено и отгружено 924 тыс. тонн). 2.6. Производство авиатоплива Производство отечественного авиатоплива марок TC-1 и РТ возросло с 3091 до 746 тыс. тонн (+248 %) при потребности до 900 тыс. тонн. Авиатопливо в приоритетном порядке распределяется казахстанским авиакомпаниям, подразделениям вооруженных сил, гражданской защиты и государственного материального резерва. Также для международных аэропортов предусматривается импорт до 3090 тыс. тонн в год российского авиатоплива марок ТС-1 и РТ в рамках индикативного баланса между министерствами Республики Казахстан и Российской Федерации. Вместе с тем развитие казахстанских авиационных хабов и активизация авиационного транзита приводят к необходимости импорта авиатоплива Jet А-1 из стран ближнего и дальнего зарубежья и, соответственно, создания отечественного научно-исследовательского института (далее - НИИ) нефтепереработки и нефтехимии, в том числе для сертификации и аккредитации импортных авиатоплив и разработки национальных стандартов. Также КМГ прорабатывается возможность производства SAF - sustainable aviation fuel или устойчивого авиатоплива."}

Производство мазута Средняя глубина переработки нефти в 2023 году составила 85 %, что также прямо влияет на выработку востребованных светлых и менее ценных темных нефтепродуктов. Так, производство мазута на крупных НПЗ в 2023 году составило 2,3 млн тонн или 13 % на нефть при внутренней потребности порядка 900 тыс. тонн в год (заводское топливо, отопление социальных объектов и теплоэлектроцентраль). Мазут может являться ценным сырьем нефтехимического синтеза. 2.8.

Раздел 3. Обзор международного опыта 3.1. Устойчивое развитие нефтепереработки В настоящее время по данным стабильным. PEC Annual statistical bulletin - 2623\" ежегодный спрос на нефть продолжает оставаться Так, в 2022 году мировой спрос на нефть вырос на 2,49 млн барр./сут. или на 2,6 % по сравнению с 2621 годом и достиг 99,5 млн барр./сут. Спрос на нефть вырос почти во всех регионах, и наибольший прирост зафиксирован в странах Северной и Южной Америки Европы, Индии, странах Азии, Ближнего Востока и Африки, в том числе спрос на нефть в странах Организации стран-экспортУров нефти (далее - ОПЕК) в 2022 году увеличился на 9,57 млн барр./сут. или 6,9%. При этом суммарная мощность мировых НПЗ также растет, и в период 1960 - 2022 годы возросла с 24,4 до 101,8 млн барр./сут. или с 1,2 до 5 млрд тонн в год. Наибольшее увеличение нефтеперерабатывающих мощностей произошло в странах, не входящих в организацию экономического сотрудничества и развития (далее - ОЭСР), особенно на Ближнем Востоке и в Китае, то есть в регионах, близко расположенных к Казахстану. Наибольший объем мощностей НПЗ сосредоточен в странах ОЭСР Северной и Южной Америки - 21,6 млн барр./сут., из них 17,7 млн барр./сут. приходится на США, далее следует Китай - 17,2 млн барр./сут. и европейские страны ОЭСР - 14 млн барр./сут., НПЗ России оцениваются в 7,1 млн барр. /сут. Текущая производительность НПЗ достигает 83,8 из 191,8 млн баррелей в сутки или 4 из 4,9 млрд тонн, что составляет 82 % имеющихся мировых мощностей на фоне высокого спроса на нефть. Потребность в светлых нефтепродуктах составляет 61 % мирового спроса на нефть, в мазуте - 6,7%, остальное приходится на сжиженные газы, смазочные масла, нефтяной кокс, дорожный битум, растворители, серу, технологическое топливо и потери и др. По долгосрочным прогнозам ОПЕК к 2035 году 80 % прироста в потреблении нефти придутся на развивающиеся азиатские страны, при этом прирост населения в мире и рост ВВП являются ключевыми факторами увеличения энергопотребления, в том числе нефти и, следовательно, нефтепродуктов. По прогнозам \"ExxonMobil Global Outlook: Our view to 2050” нефть и природный газ останутся важнейшим компонентом глобальной энергетической системы до 2050 года. Ожидается, что использование нефти значительно сократится в секторе личного автотранспорта, однако нефть по-прежнему будет все также широко использоваться в промышленности и большегрузным транспортом - судоходство, дальнемагистральные грузоперевозки и авиация, которые являются основой экономического роста. Если в 2035 году каждый новый легковой автомобиль будет электромобилем, спрос на нефть в 2050 году по-прежнему будет составлять 85 млн барр./сут., как и в 2019 году. Международное энергетическое агентство (далее - МЭА) в ежегодном обзоре \"World Energy Outlook 2023\" ожидает достижения пика потребления нефти в мире - 191,5 млн барр./сут. к 2030 году. Далее прогнозируется постепенное снижение спроса до 97,4 млн барр. /сут. или на 4 % до 26050 года. Доля ископаемых видов топлива для производства энергии по оценке МЭА снизится с 66 % в 2022 году до 55 %"}
{"chunk_id": "law_ru_Закон1_8", "category": "law", "language": "ru", "source": "data\\law\\ru\\Закон1.pdf", "text": "к 2050 года, то есть на нефть, газ и уголь все равно будет приходиться более половины всего объема, в том числе доля нефти снизится с 38 до 33%, но будет самой высокой среди энергоресурсов в мире. Обзор МЭА предусматривает также “Net Zero Emissions Бу 2050 Scenario” или сценарий \"Нулевых выбросов парниковых газов к 2050 году\", предполагающий активную реализацию принципов ESG. При этом в развивающихся странах, прежде всего в азиатских, где наблюдается рост населения и числа автомобилей, спрос на нефть продолжит расти до 2050 года. Таким образом, учитывая прогнозы мировых компаний до 2050 года, подтверждается необходимость устойчивого развития нефтеперерабатывающей отрасли Казахстана до 2040 года 3.2. Обеспечение сырьем НПЗ Экономическая целесообразность проектов развития нефтепереработки зависит от ряда факторов, в том числе стоимости нефти, рыночного спроса и ценообразования на нефтепродукты. Обеспеченность нефтью НПЗ, к примеру, в странах ОЭСР достигается за счет экспорта нефти в случае отсутствия собственной нефти или за счет равнодоходности поставок добываемой внутри страны нефти на внутренний и внешний рынки и, следовательно, выравнивания цен на нефтепродукты на внутреннем и внешнем рынках. Актуальные котировки цен на нефть и нефтепродукты приводятся в таких специализированных изданиях, как \"Argus\" и “Platts”, что позволяет рассчитывать экономическую целесообразность проектов нефтепереработки. 3.3. Эффективное и безопасное функционирование НПЗ Период работы технологического оборудования и трубопроводов, энергооборудования и систем АСУТП и КИП и А между двумя очередными планово-предупредительными работами современных НПЗ, как правило, составляет 3-4 года. Увеличенный межремонтный период НПЗ достигается за счет комплекса мер, в том числе применения риск-ориентированного подхода на основе серии международных стандартов ISO 55000 “Asset management” и цифровых систем управления основными фондами, надежности активов, онлайн-диагностики состояния оборудования, актуализации национальных стандартов по планированию, организации и проведению технического обслуживания и ремонта оборудования. Для обеспечения надежной и безопасной эксплуатации оборудования требуются контроль технического состояния машинного и технологического оборудования, диагностирование оборудования с целью определения остаточного ресурса и допустимого срока эксплуатации, экспертиза промышленной безопасности, повышение надежности эксплуатации оборудования за счет модернизации, обновления, улучшения технологических процессов, регенерации и замены катализаторов. Конкурентоспособность НПЗ по привлечению и удержанию квалифицированных технических специалистов на предприятии основана на своевременной подготовке кадров на ключевые позиции и рабочие профессии, формировании и организации работ с кадровым резервом, предусматривающим подготовку оперативного и стратегического резерва. Увеличение межремонтного периода, снижение внеплановых остановок и аварийности улучшают показатели финансово-хозяйственной деятельности предприятия и позволяют инвестировать в новые проекты развития НПЗ. 3.4. Обеспечение растущей экономики отечественными нефтепродуктами Для обеспечения экономики нефтепродуктами необходимо также улучшать соотношение добычи и переработки нефти на примере стран с развитой и развивающейся экономикой. В таблице ниже сопоставлены данные из \"BP Statistical review of world energy\", “OPEC Annual statistical bulletin\": № п/п Страна и население, Нефтедобыча, Нефтепереработка, Соотношение добычи и млн. чел. млн. тонн/год млн. тонн/год переработки 1 2 3 4 5 1 США. 711 870 0,8 337,5 2 КНР 199 840 90,2 1 411 3 Россия 536 350 1,5 146,4 4 Индия 34 245 0,14 1 428 5 Южная Корея 2 175 0,01 52 6 Япония 1 160 0,006 124,5 7 Саудовская Аравия 515 142 3,6 37,8 8 Иран 168 123 1,4 89,2 9 Бразилия 157 112 1,4 217,7 18 Германия 1,7 104 0,02"}

Наиболее близким и ценным к Казахстану может оказаться опыт Саудовской Аравии и Канады. Также, принимая во внимание ориентировочное соотношение численности населения к мощностям нефтепереработки 1к 1, можно сделать вывод об обеспеченности нефтепродуктами 11 стран в вышеуказанной таблице, кроме Китая, Индии, Бразилии и Мексики В международной практике в качестве показателей операционной эффективности и оснащенности технологической схемы НПЗ используются степень или коэффициент конверсии (глубина переработки нефти), индекс технологической сложности Нельсона и предлагаемый коэффициент МТУ (materials targeted yield), характеризующий соотношение выработки и начального содержания в нефти светлых нефтепродуктов в пределах 1,4 - 2,4. Глубина переработки нефти используется как показатель эффективности нефтепереработки и выработки светлых нефтепродуктов зависит от набора технологических процессов, потенциального содержания светлых фракций в нефти и производственной программы НПЗ. Глубина переработки нефти в Европе составляет 85-90 %, США - 95-96 %. Индекс Нельсона характеризует сложность технологической схемы или уровень технологичности НПЗ, в международной практике данный показатель находится между 1 и 2@ при среднемировых значениях 8 - 19. Наиболее современные НПЗ США и Европы имеют индекс Нельсона свыше 15, при этом по мнению зарубежных экспертов в рыночных условиях конкурентоспособными останутся НПЗ с индексом Нельсона 19 и выше. Высокий индекс Нельсона означает высокий уровень технологичности НПЗ. Низкий индекс Нельсона означает более простую схему, но более высокий потенциал развития НПЗ, например, в направлении топливно-нефтехимической конфигурации для выработки базового сырья нефтехимии или топливно-масляной конфигурации для выработки базовых масел. 3.6. Развитие экспортного потенциала Как видно из таблицы выше, высокий объем добычи позволяет Российской Федерации, Саудовской Аравии и Канаде перерабатывать собственную нефть и обеспечивать внутренние рынки, а также экспортировать нефть и нефтепродукты в различные регионы мира Развитые страны - Сингапур, Япония, Южная Корея, Испания, Китай, не имеющие или почти не имеющие месторождений нефти, имеют современные НПЗ и обеспечивают внутренний и внешний рынки нефтепродуктами. В Китае имеется опыт эксплуатации 24 тыс. км. нефтепродуктопроводов между различными регионами, что позволяет снижать до 20-30 % транспортные расходы в сравнении с железнодорожными перевозками. Также в соответствии с рекомендациями Европейского Союза и Международного энергетического агентства для каждой страны предусматриваются обязательства по наличию резервов нефтепродуктов, например, департамент энергетики и климата Великобритании контролирует наличие в стране 22-дневного запаса нефтепродуктов, в Румынии такой запас составляет 38 дней и в США - 22 дня. По данным МЭА спрос на нефть и, следовательно, на нефтепродукты продолжит расти до 2050 года, прежде всего в развивающихся азиатских странах, где наблюдается рост населения и числа автомобилей. Таким образом, страны с современными НПЗ будут иметь также стабильный экспортный потенциал нефтепродуктов в страны с растущей экономикой, в том числе в страны Центральной, Южной и Юго-Западной Азии с населением до 430 млн. чел. в настоящее время. Кроме того, формирование общих рынков нефти и нефтепродуктов Евразийского экономического союза предусматривает"}

Предусмотрено соблюдение баланса экономических и национальных интересов государств-членов и их национального законодательства 3.7. Соответствие принципам ESG Качество нефтепродуктов. Международной компанией \"IHS Markit\" проведены маркетинговые исследования по прогнозу развития рынка нефтепродуктов Казахстана, включая производство и потребление сжиженного нефтяного газа, рост потребления в соседних государствах и транзитного грузопотока до 2035 года. Предлагаемый \"IHS Markit\" рациональный подход заключается в ужесточении топливных стандартов и обеспечении роста эффективности за счет более высокого уровня цен вместо отслеживания выбросов транспорта в окружающую среду. Стандарт Euro-5 начал действовать в Европе с 2008 года, стандарт К5 действует в России с 2016 года Стандарт Euro-6 начал действовать в Европе с 2015 года и по своим требованиям близок к действующим с 2010 года экологическим стандартам EPA1@ в США и японскому Post NLT. Китай перешел со стандарта China-V на China VI-b в 2023 году. Австралия планирует переход с Euro-5 на Euro-6 в 2025 году. Европа планирует принятие стандарта Euro-7 в 2025 году. Для соответствия принципам ESG целесообразным являются повышение казахстанскими НПЗ качественных, в том числе экологических, характеристик моторных топлив и, следовательно, производство моторных топлив высших экологических классов: К5 и Кб+ (аналоги Euro-5 и Euro-6+), а также авиатоплива Jet А-1 наряду с ТС-1 и РТ.К примеру, Jet А-1, которое используется в более, чем 70 странах мира. В настоящее время отсутствуют требования к экологическому классу Кб в таких нормативных документах ЕАЭС и Республики Казахстан, как: \"Технический регламент Таможенного союза TP ТС № 013/2011 \"О требованиях к автомобильному и авиационному бензину, дизельному и судовому топливу, топливу для реактивных двигателей и мазуту\"; межгосударственный стандарт ГОСТ 32513-2013 \"Топлива моторные. Бензин неэтилированный межгосударственный стандарт ГОСТ 32511-2013 (ЕМ 590:2009) \"Топливо дизельное Евро. Технические условия\"; национальные стандарты и стандарты организаций Республики Казахстан.

Нефтепереработка - одна из наиболее энергоемких отраслей производства, и, следовательно, особого внимания требует вопрос повышения энергоэффективности, в том числе снижения технологических потерь и топлив НПЗ. Отмечается, что казахстанские НПЗ по своему технологическому состоянию соответствуют требованиям по энергоэффективности, представленным в справочнике по наилучшим доступным техникам в справочнике \"Переработка нефти и газа\", утвержденном постановлением Правительства Республики Казахстан от 23 ноября 2023 года № 1024. Вместе с тем в международной практике используются показатель Energy Intensity Index - EII или индекс энергоэффективности, который является соотношением фактического энергопотребления предприятия к энергопотреблению среднемирового НПЗ подобной конфигурации и может определяться как для всего завода, так и для каждой его технологической установки. Высокий уровень энергоэффективности соответствует низкому ЕТТ. Так, анализ показателей 2020 года показал, что ЕТТ отечественных НПЗ соответствует IV группе наименее энергоэффективных и наиболее углеродоемких НПЗ при среднемировых значениях 68-85: Атырауского НПЗ - 144, Павлодарского НПЗ - 133 и Шымкентского НПЗ - 164. Таким образом, имеется значительный потенциал по повышению энергоэффективности и, следовательно, улучшению экономики производства и состояния окружающей среды. Экологические производства вокруг НПЗ. В международной практике встречаются проекты по извлечению редкоземельных металлов № и Мо из отработанных катализаторов крекинга, использованию углекислого газа CO, в овощные теплицы. Развитие человеческого капитала. Развитие нефтеперерабатывающей отрасли невозможно обеспечить без ускоренного развития и эффективного использования человеческого капитала. В настоящее время на НПЗ отмечаются высокая текучесть кадров, прежде всего высококвалифицированного инженерно-технического персонала ключевых технологических установок НПЗ и отсутствие преемственности кадров (формирование и взращивание кадрового резерва на каждую ключевую инженерно-техническую позицию). Для комплексного решения проблемы необходимы создание отслеживающей и опережающей отраслевые тренды системы профессионального образования и подготовки специалистов и рабочих кадров, а также разработка и распространение новых форм и программ государственного и корпоративного обучения, подготовки, переподготовки и повышения квалификации 3.7. Развитие прикладной науки Одним из значимых примеров развития прикладной науки для решения отраслевых задач являются создание НИИ нефтепереработки и нефтехимии \"ТЕР Energies nouvelles\" или Французский институт нефти, топлива и смазочных масел, основанный в 1919 году. В 2001 году одно из специализированных подразделений института преобразовано в международную компанию \"Ахепз\" по базовому проектированию технологических процессов, производству и поставке катализаторов и адсорбентов нефтепереработки и нефтехимии по всему миру. Известный \"American Petroleum Institute” или Американский институт нефти, основанный в 1919 году, на сегодня разработал более 500 используемых стандартов в нефтяной и газовой отраслях во всем мире Также отмечается опыт развития “The Energy Institute\" по вопросам нефти и энергетики в Великобритании, датского \"The technical university of Denmark\" и \"Haldor Торзое\" по разработке катализаторов, российских АО \"ВНИИ НП\" по технологии смазочных масел и ФГУП \"ГОСНИИГА\" по вопросам авиатоплива польского “Instytut Nafty i баги\" по принципам государственно-частного партнерства. 3.8. Повышение вклада нефтепереработки в ВВП страны По расчетам российского экономического университета имени Г.В. Плеханова вклад нефтеперерабатывающей отрасли в ВВП Казахстана в 2005 году составлял 5 млрд долл по паритету покупательной способности и может увеличиться до 38,4 млрд долл к 2050 году или с 2,4 до 2,8 %. По более актуальным прогнозам \"Goldman Sachs\" от 2023 года ВВП Казахстана возрастет с @,26 до 0,9 трлн долл к 2050 году, что подтверждает потенциал развития экономики, в том числе за счет вклада нефтеперерабатывающей"}

Соответствие Концепции развитию экономики Видение устойчивого и опережающего развития нефтеперерабатывающей отрасли с учетом региональных и мировых вызовов полностью соответствует таким тезисам в Послании Главы государства Токаева К.К. от 1 сентября 2023 года, как формирование промышленного каркаса и обеспечение экономической самодостаточности страны, ускоренное развитие обрабатывающего сектора, глубокая переработка и создание кластеров высокого передела. При этом по данным Министерства труда и социальной защиты населения Республики Казахстан население Казахстана может достигнуть численности от 23,5 до 27,7 млн человек к 2050 году, следовательно, прогнозируемый рост экономики и увеличения промышленных предприятий, численности населения и числа автомобилей приведет к устойчивому увеличению спроса на нефтепродукты. Таким образом, в среднесрочной перспективе необходимо решить ожидаемую нехватку нефтепродуктов на внутреннем рынке и начать развивать экспортный потенциал в ближайшие регионы, для этого целесообразно: вначале использовать потенциал расширения действующих заводов; далее инициировать строительство нового НПЗ. Расширение действующих НПЗ является целесообразным по ряду причин, в том числе наиболее густонаселенными регионами и, следовательно, имеющими наибольший спрос на нефтепродукты, являются южные регионы Казахстана и регионы Центральной, Южной и Юго- Западной Азии. Кроме того, действующие НПЗ имеют такие преимущества, как квалифицированные кадры с опытом модернизации и пуско-наладки новых объектов, развитая инфраструктура, включающая нефтепроводы, железнодорожные и автомобильные дороги для поставки нового оборудования и материалов в случаях расширения и отгрузки большего объема нефтепродуктов, эстакады подачи и источники энергоресурсов. Таким образом, в период 2009-2019 годов нефтеперерабатывающей отраслью Казахстана накоплен достаточный опыт реализации крупномасштабных проектов расширения мощностей и глубины переработки нефти. Так, в настоящее время начаты работы по увеличению объемов нефтепереработки с 18 до 29,2 млн тонн в год, в том числе за счет проектов расширения обрабатывающих мощностей: Шымкентского НПЗ - с 6 до 12 млн тонн/год нефти; Павлодарского НХЗ - с 5,5 до 9 млн тонн/год нефти в 2 этапа; CaspiBitum - с 1 до 1,5 млн тонн/год нефти; Атырауского НПЗ - на @,7 - 1,2 млн тонн/год мощностей вторичной переработки нефти или с 5,5 до 6,7 млн тонн/год по сырью. Также потенциальными инвесторами прорабатывается проект производства линейного алкилбензола из производимого бензола. Проект расширения Шымкентского НПЗ включен в перечень из не менее чем 17 крупных проектов для создания кластеров высокого передела в соответствии с Посланием Главы государства от 1 сентября 2023 года. Для активизации проекта и привлечения потенциальных инвесторов и стратегических партнеров планируется к подписанию межправительственное соглашение (стабильность законодательства, долгосрочное обеспечение сырьем, возможность"}

В зависимости от перспективной конфигурации схемы Шымкентского НПЗ будет проработан проект производства линейного алкилбензола потенциальными инвесторами. При этом проект Шымкентского НПЗ должен быть одобрен Государственной комиссией по модернизации экономики. Реализация высокотехнологичных проектов приведет к увеличению НПЗ глубины переработки нефти с 89 до 94 % и базовой нефтехимии для дальнейших переделов потенциальными инвесторами: бензола, параксилола, алкилбензола, а также алкилатов и олигомеризатов с учетом новых вариантов топливно-нефтехимической конфигурации расширяемых и нового НПЗ Вместе с тем целесообразно начинать проектирование нового НПЗ мощностью 10 млн тонн/год не позднее 2039 года и его строительство в 2032 году в связи с новым ожидаемым дефицитом светлых нефтепродуктов в 2036 году. Такой вывод вытекает из оценки производства-потребления, например, дизтоплива, связанного с ростом населения с 20 до 27,7 млн человек и, следовательно, отечественного, а также транзитного транспорта: - 203@ г. - расширение Шымкентского НПЗ с 6 до 12 млн тонн/год приведет к профициту дизтоплива 1,8 млн тонн - 2030 - 2036 гг. - увеличение потребности на дополнительные 2 млн. тонн, что приведет к нехватке 0,2 млн тонн дизтоплива, ежегодно возрастающей на @,3-@,35 млн тонн до 2049 г.; - 2032 - 2040 гг. - строительство нового НПЗ мощностью 19 млн. тонн/год (2030-2032 гг. - разработка T30 и NCA); - 2040 г. - полная обеспеченность внутреннего рынка ГСМ и, соответственно, экспорт на развивающиеся рынки Центральной, Южной и Юго-Западной Азии общей численностью на сегодня до 430 млн чел. в соответствии с прогнозами ОПЕК, ExxonMobil и Международного энергетического агентства OT 2022-2023 гг Конфигурация и, следовательно, линейка продукции нового НПЗ будут определены на основании актуальных требований рынка ГСМ и базовой нефтехимии в рамках T30. Также реализация битумных проектов приведет к суммарному увеличению мощностей на 980 тыс. тонн/год битума: Павлодарский НХЗ - пуск новой печи увеличивает выработку битума с текущих 28@ до 310 тыс. тонн в 2025 году; CaspiBitum - увеличение выработки битума с 500 до 750 тыс. тонн/год за счет увеличения переработки каражанбасской нефти с 1 до 1,5 млн тонн/год в 2025 году; TOO “Batys Bitum\", г. Актобе - строительство нового производства на 700 тыс. тонн/год битума к 2026 году, сырье - российский гудрон. В рамках решения поставленных перед вновь создаваемым НИИ нефтепереработки и нефтехимии задач предстоят комплексное исследование нефтеперерабатывающей и нефтехимической отрасли в Республике Казахстан, выявление основных вызовов и возможностей для улучшения производства, определения целесообразности расширения или строительства новых мощностей НПЗ и НХЗ. Также в рамках Указа Президента Республики Казахстан от 8 мая 2024 года № 552 \"О мерах по либерализации экономики\" будут приниматься системные меры по комплексной либерализации экономики, в том числе в отношении ценообразования ГСМ, для обеспечения реализации проектов промышленного каркаса и точек технологического и экономического роста страны. 4.2. Вовлечение в единый технологический цикл переработки нефти крупных нефтегазовых проектов В утверждаемых Министерством энергетики специальных паспортах производства НПЗ приводится перечень технологических объектов и технологических процессов, представляющих собой единый технологический цикл для выпуска нефтепродуктов, в том числе по стандартам К-4 и К-5, взамен отмененного в 2011 году лицензирования деятельности НПЗ.

{"chunk_id": "law_ru_Закон1_14", "category": "law", "language": "ru", "source": "data\\law\\ru\\Закон1.pdf", "text": "нефтеперерабатывающей промышленности применяются специальные технологические процессы, как гидроочистка, изомеризация, каталитический крекинг и каталитический риформинг с добавлением различных антидетонационных присадок. Для дизтоплива экологических классов К4 и К5 массовая доля серы не должна превышать 50 мг/кг и 19 мг/кг, что достигается за счет процесса гидроочистки (термокаталитическая обработка с гидрированием серосодержащих соединений в реакторах со специальным материальным исполнением во избежание водородной коррозии сепараторами высокого и низкого давления, трубчатыми печами, источником водорода и др.). В соответствии с постановлением Правительства Республики Казахстан от 309 июня 2008 года № 651 Атырауский, Павлодарский и Шымкентский НПЗ являются стратегическими объектами с сохранением государственного контроля в управлении активами. Также согласно пункту 1 статьи 22 Закона Республики Казахстан \"О национальной безопасности Республики Казахстан\" обеспечение экономической безопасности включает в себя \"энергетическую безопасность, предусматривающую состояние защищенности топливно- энергетического, нефтегазового и атомно-энергетического комплексов экономики от реальных и потенциальных угроз, при котором государство способно обеспечить энергетическую независимость и их устойчивое развитие для удовлетворения потребностей общества и государства в энергоресурсах\" . Усовершенствованный паспорт производства предусматривает на основании проведенного в 2022-2023 годах аудита систем безопасности и контроля производства, хранения, вывоза продукции и иных технологических процессов в Атырауском, Павлодарском и Шымкентском НПЗ следующие направления: - нефть - технологические схемы подготовки нефти, контроль и учет; - технологические объекты - потери и топливо, управление процессами; - нефтепродукты - система безопасности и контроля отгрузки продукции. В условиях регулирования рынка нефтепродуктов в Республике Казахстан и периодической нехватки из-за диспаритета цен на ГСМ обеспечение внутреннего рынка нефтепродуктами напрямую зависит от выполнения НПЗ производственной программы, утверждаемой Министерством энергетики. Таким образом, КМГ и принадлежащие ему активы переработки позволяют сохранять энергетическую безопасность страны, при этом имеется нехватка с 2030 года сырья для казахстанских НПЗ в условиях истощения \"зрелых\" месторождений, что потребует вовлечения нефти “новых” месторождений \"Тенгиз\" и \"Кашаган\". Обеспеченность нефтью НПЗ, на примере стран ОЭСР, будет достигнута за счет равнодоходности поставок добываемой нефти на внутренний и внешний рынки. В свою очередь равнодоходность поставок нефти приведет к выравниванию цен нефтепродуктов на внутреннем и внешнем рынках и, следовательно, уменьшит соотношение между объемами нефтедобычи и нефтепереработки с 5 до 3,9 и это значение не должно являться предельным. Соотношение добычи и переработки нефти в Казахстане улучшается по мере ввода новых перерабатывающих мощностей на примере технологически развитых Саудовской Аравии и Канады. 4.3. Эффективное и безопасное функционирование за счет инвестирования в высокотехнологичные и капиталоемкие проекты развития НПЗ В рамках перехода на увеличенный межремонтный период на АНПЗ, ПНХЗ и ШНПЗ с использованием риск-ориентированного подхода продолжается развитие цифровых систем \"ТОРО\", \"IBM Maximo\" (управление основными фондами НПЗ), \"Meridium APM GE (управление надежностью производственных активов)\", “Asset Sentinel\" (контроль работоспособности оборудования), онлайн-диагностика состояния статического и динамического оборудования (датчики и передача с датчиков информации инженерам), национальных стандартов по нормам потребности в товарно-материальных ценностях, в том числе запчасти для внеплановых остановок Реализация Комплексного плана по снижению аварийности НПЗ в 2023-2028 годы при соотношении прежнего оборудования со сроком службы свыше 20 лет / нового оборудования - 68 % /40 % требует: соблюдения нормативно-правовых актов, в том числе СТ РК 3731-2021 \"Промышленность нефтяная и газовая.

Обеспечение растущей экономики отечественными нефтепродуктами и экспорт нефтепродуктов Министерствами энергетики Республики Казахстан и Российской Федерации ежегодно согласовываются планы импорта 285 тыс. тонн автобензинов, 300 тыс. тонн авиатоплив, 4509 тыс. тонн дизтоплива, 280 тыс. тонн гудрона и 300 тыс. тонн дорожного битума. В 2018 году начат экспорт казахстанского автобензина производства Атырауского НПЗ в Европу и Шымкентского НПЗ в Центральную Азию, но в настоящее время экспорт прекращен для обеспечения внутреннего рынка, в первую очередь в связи с тем, что в стране рост потребления моторных топлив увеличивается в среднем до 29 % в год. На сегодня экспорт таких нефтепродуктов, как = автобензины, авиатопливо и дизтопливо, битум не осуществляется в связи с необходимостью поставок на внутренний рынок - мазут осуществляется, т.к. не находит спроса на внутреннем рынке, но является в зарубежных странах ценным сырьем процессов глубокой переработки нефти: крекинга в производстве светлых нефтепродуктов, вакуумной перегонки в производстве гудрона и, предположительно, базовых смазочных масел. 4.5. Соответствие принципам ESG и декарбонизации Выработка авиатоплив Jet-1 и моторных топлив экологических классов К5, в том числе мини-НПЗ, обеспечит соответствие ESG- принципам. Изучается переход на более экологические стандарты Кб - K1@ для нефтепродуктов и двигателей Также на НПЗ будут установлены автоматизированные системы мониторинга эмиссий (далее - АСМ), позволяющие в режиме реального времени отслеживать содержание оксида и диоксида азота, оксида углерода в отходящих газах, измерять физические параметры газов. Реализация в рамках комплекса природоохранных мероприятий НПЗ мероприятий по снижению уровня технологических потерь и топлив модернизации и расширению очистных сооружений, повышение повторного использования воды и рекультивации полей испарения, снижение выбросов при использовании наиболее энергоэффективных технологий и материалов также относятся к принципам ESG и декарбонизации. Процессы декарбонизации отрасли должны учитывать такие мероприятия, как снижение эмиссий и парниковых газов, внедрение наилучших доступных техник, водоэффективность, уменьшение объемов захоронения отходов и экологический мониторинг выбросов в период как проектирования, строительства, так и пуско-наладки и ввода в эксплуатацию расширяемых и новых НПЗ. Предполагается также участие представителей НПЗ в деятельности рабочих групп профильных государственных органов по непрерывной реализации и усовершенствованию принципов декарбонизации. Разработка и адаптация показателей моторных топлив класса Кб+ потребуют привлечения НИИ нефтепереработки и нефтехимии и профильных государственных органов в отношении автомобильных двигателей,"}

Развитие прикладной науки Развитие нефтеперерабатывающей отрасли приводит к необходимости создания специализированного отраслевого НИИ нефтепереработки и нефтехимии в Республике Казахстан К проактивным задачам НИИ относятс 1. Комплексное исследование нефтеперерабатывающей и нефтехимической отрасли в Республике Казахстан, выявление основных вызовов и возможностей для улучшения производства, определение целесообразности строительства новых мощностей НПЗ и НХЗ. 2.

Разработка отраслевых нормативных актов, в том числе нормативных документов, национальных стандартов в области авиационных и моторных топлив (K6+ / Euro-6+). 8. Взаимодействие с государственными структурами и бизнес-сообществом для внедрения исследовательских разработок в реальные производственные условия, в том числе производство катализаторов, вовлечение в переработку альтернативного сырья, повышение эффективности процессов и в целом - переосмысление традиционной архитектуры нефтепереработки и нефтехимии 9. Выдача допуска на производство авиатоплива в качестве независимой специализированной организации Дальнейшие работы будут проводиться НИИ с учетом технического аудита КМГ по трем НПЗ исходя из конкретных задач и проблем НПЗ, с учетом комплаенс-процедур КМГ и Фондом. 4.7. Повышение ВВП страны с учетом поэтапной либерализации рынка 7 февраля 2024 года Глава государства в рамках расширенного заседания Правительства Республики Казахстан отметил о необходимости принятия системных мер для комплексной либерализации экономики Также в соответствии с Договором о Евразийском экономическом союзе государства-члены осуществляют поэтапное формирование общих рынков на основе обеспечения рыночного ценообразования на энергетические ресурсы в целях эффективного использования потенциала топливно-энергетических комплексов и обеспечения национальных экономик основными видами энергетических ресурсов. При этом в связи с чрезмерным государственным регулированием цен Казахстан является страной с наименьшей стоимостью на нефтепродукты среди стран Евразийского экономического союза (разница достигает 1,1-1,7 раза) и, следовательно, перетоки и нехватка нефтепродуктов приводят к меньшему вкладу в экономику страны. Будет проработан вопрос поэтапного доведения цен на регулируемые нефтепродукты (автобензины, дизтопливо и авиатопливо) до уровня сопредельных стран для исключения неконтролируемых перетоков и повышения экономической целесообразности проектов развития НПЗ. По предварительным расчетам в случае реализации проекта расширения Шымкентского НПЗ государственный бюджет получит прямые выгоды в виде налоговых поступлений в размере 4,3 трлн тенге за период 2030-2045 годы. Ключевым вопросом в расчетах экономической целесообразности проекта расширения Шымкентского НПЗ является необходимость вовлечения нефти \"новых\" месторождений \"Тенгиз\" и \"Кашаган\" в условиях истощения \"зрелых\" месторождений с 2030 года в рамках Межправительственного соглашения между Республикой Казахстан и Китайской Народной Республикой. Соотношение добычи и переработки нефти в Казахстане улучшается с 5 до 3,9 по мере ввода новых перерабатывающих мощностей на примере технологически развитых Саудовской Аравии и Канады, и это не должно являться предельным значением (рассматривается возможность доведения до"}

В конечном итоге в 2032 году планируется увеличить на @,2-8,35 п.п. вклад отрасли в ВВП страны за счет реализации высокотехнологичных и капиталоемких проектов НПЗ. 4.8. Непрерывность улучшения деятельности НПЗ В период 2932-204@ годов будет продолжаться устойчивое и непрерывное улучшение деятельности крупных и малых НПЗ с учетом рекомендаций таких заинтересованных государственных органов, как агентства по защите и развитию конкуренции и финансового мониторинга. Улучшение будет достигаться за счет развития биржевого механизма ценообразования и доли торгов, мер по сохранению баланса производства, потребления и запасов нефтепродуктов, устранения непродуктивных посредников, пересмотра и совершенствования паспортов производства по технологическим схемам, линейке продукции и кодов ТН ВЭД, требований производства 20 - 40 % масс. подакцизных нефтепродуктов уровня К5 и Кб от общей выработки продукции в рамках соответствия принципам ESG, снижения технологических потерь и топлив. В комплексе мер это приведет к развитию рыночных механизмов ценообразования на примере развитых стран, когда рынок диктует спрос, предложение и возможность выбора потребителем нефтепродуктов. Также будут проработаны вопросы загрузки нефтью существующих НПЗ, в том числе государственного стимулирования проектов развития мини-НПЗ. 4.9. Формирование общих рынков нефти и нефтепродуктов Евразийского экономического союза В соответствии с последними решениями государства-члены ЕАЭС осуществляют к 1 января 2027 года поэтапное формирование общих рынков энергоресурсов, в том числе нефти и нефтепродуктов. При этом договор о формировании общих рынков обуславливает приоритетность обеспечения внутреннего рынка государств-членов, в том числе в правилах нефти и нефтепродуктов: 1) доступа к системам транспортировки; 2) торговли; 3) биржевых торгов. Также предусмотрено соблюдение баланса экономических и национальных интересов и законодательства государств-членов. Формирование общих рынков обеспечит в пределах технических возможностей гарантированное осуществление долгосрочной транспортировки нефти и нефтепродуктов на территориях государств-членов Также с учетом экспорта избытка ГСМ в первую очередь в страны ЕАЭС будут проработаны месторасположение и источники финансирования казахстанских хранилищ автобензина, авиатоплива и дизтоплива в период 2025-2030 годов. Необходимость наличия таких стратегических хранилищ отмечается в Национальном энергетическом докладе ассоциации “Kazenergy”. 4.10. Пути снижения внеплановых остановок и аварийных ситуаций на НПЗ Снижение количества внеплановых остановок и аварийных ситуаций достигается путем внедрения международного опыта по внедрению риск-ориентированного стандарта ISO 55000 “Asset management\", а также - своевременностью проведения планово-предупредительных работ НПЗ (без переносов); - своевременностью финансирования на системной основе мер по техническому обслуживанию и надзору оборудования; - своевременностью комплектования новых объектов квалифицированными кадрами; - недопущением круглогодичной работы НПЗ на предельных мощностях - от 95 до 105 % от проектных; - недопущением превышения расчетного срока службы оборудования 29-25 лет и своевременностью замены; - стабильностью подачи внешних энергоресурсов; созданием и привлечением отраслевого НИИ нефтепереработки и нефтехимии для превентивного анализа и выработки мер по снижению внеплановых остановок. По данным американской компании “Solomon Associates\" среднестатистический показатель затрат 400 НПЗ на ремонт и техническое обслуживание равен 50 058 тыс. долл в год, следовательно, необходим анализ затрат НПЗ, как минимум, в период 2019-2024 гг. на ремонт и техническое обслуживание, влияние на исправность оборудования, выработку соответствующих мер по снижению аварийности.

To achieve this, there have been significant improvements to the existing network of oil and gas pipelines, promoting international trade and co­operation in the energy markets to further strengthen the emerging market economy. O i l . Kazakhstan has estimated proven reserves of roughly 30 billion barrels of crude oil, or almost 3% of global reserves and is the second largest oil producer among the former Soviet states. In the first 11 months of 2012, Kazakhstan produced approximately 61 million tonnes of oil. It is forecasted that by 2020 Kazakhstan's oil production will increase up to 140 million tonnes per year. Over 90% of Kazakhstan's oil deposits can be found in just 15 fields: Karachaganak, Uzen, Zhetybay, Zhanazhol, Kalamkas, Kenkiyak, Karazhanbas, Kumkol, North Buzachi, Alibekmola, Central and East Prova, Kenby and Korolevskoye. The largest two fields Kashagan and Tengiz hold about half of the total deposits (Tengiz itself accounts for nearly a third of the total production). Most of the production fields are to be found in the north west of the country, in the Atyrau, Aktobe, West­Kazakhstan and Mangistau regions. G a s a n d L N G . Kazakhstan has abundant natural gas reserves, the bulk of these being comprised of associated gas. Kazakhstan has some of the largest gas reserves in the world, with 45.7 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves. As the gas is associated gas, the reserves are found in the major oil fields, with Tengiz and Karachaganak accounting for 20% and 45% of total production respectively. However, significant amounts of the extracted gas are re­injected to aid in the oil production process. T h e i m p o r t / e x p o r t m a r k e t Recent figures indicate that the oil and gas market makes up almost one third of the local Gross Domestic Product and almost two thirds of total exports. Assets held in Kazakhstan's National Fund stand at around US$60 billion. Over the past decade the level of turnover of foreign trade has increased eightfold and now stands at roughly US$130 billion per year. O i l . Kazakhstan is one of the world's major exporters of light sweet crude oil, with annual exports amounting to 1.4million bbl/d. Recent Ministry of Finance figures show that of all of Kazakhstan's foreign investors, Italy is the largest recipient of oil and gas condensate. Other notable importers are China, the Netherlands, France and Austria. The historic reliance on the old Soviet pipelines, which, since the collapse of the Soviet Union have been controlled by Russia, is gradually coming to an end and with it, Russia's total control over Kazakhstan's exports. Infrastructure improvements have largely been responsible for this, with crude being sent via the Atyrau­Samara oil pipeline to the Black Sea. Azerbaijan and Turkey provide access to the Mediterranean, by barge and the Baku­Tbilisi­Ceyhan pipeline. Exports to Georgia are sent by barge and train, whilst China is served by"}

Gas produced in Kazakhstan is destined for both home and foreign markets, with around 52% going to Russia and 48% to Ukraine (0.2% is sold to Germany). China and Iran are viewed as potential export markets for the future. Imports of natural gas mainly come from Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Russia. As gas production increases, the need to develop new exportation routes emerges. A vital role in making Kazakhstan an important transit country for natural gas exports from Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan to Russia and China are pipelines such as the: Central Asia Centre. Bukhara­Ural. Tashkent­Bishkek­Almaty. Turkmenistan­China. Kazakhstan is also looking to interconnect all its regions in a single, comprehensive domestic natural gas system. D o m e s t i c m a r k e t s t r u c t u r e Alongside a push to increase the overall production and export of oil and gas, the Government is also keen to ensure that the country's internal energy needs are met. Kazakhstan's state assets are held by the Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk­Kazyna. The Fund was established to improve competitiveness and sustainability in the national economy and is controlled by the Kazakh government. It is invariably a shareholder in all entities that own strategic assets in Kazakhstan and encompasses all investment and innovative development institutions, as well as holding interests in the local major banks and national companies. 26/12/2016 PLC ­ Oil and gas regulation in Kazakhstan: overview http://uk.practicallaw.com/3­524­5147?q=*&qp=&qo=&qe=# 3/12The final major player in the Kazakh oil and gas sector is the JSC National Company, KazMunayGas, an integrated oil and gas company that seeks to maximise the benefits for the state from its participation in the development of the oil and gas sectors by ensuring the protection of state interests and participating in every stage of the production cycle, from exploration and development all the way through to distribution and servicing. G o v e r n m e n t p o l i c y o b j e c t i v e s A significant body of legislation has been drawn up to promote foreign investment in Kazakhstan. See Question 2. The Government intends to: Promote energy independence and security. Provide a clean energy supply. Increase the efficiency of the distribution of petroleum and related products throughout Kazakhstan. C u r r e n t m a r k e t t r e n d s The past two decades have seen Kazakhstan develop into a leading oil producer, generating triple the volume of oil and gas condensate produced in the pre­independence era. According to industry analysts, Kazakhstan's planned expansion of oil production, coupled with the development of new oil fields and the expansion of existing fields will allow for the production of 2 million barrels per day by 2015, propelling Kazakhstan into the world's top ten oil producing nations. 2 .

The Government has also passed a number of laws to promote foreign investment, for example: The Law on Investments establishes a single investment regime for both foreign and domestic investors, and also provides for the national treatment and non­discrimination of foreign investors. A new customs code, tax code and a law on government procurement provides for non­expropriation, currency convertibility, transparency in government procurement and the incentivisation of certain sectors whilst providing a guarantee of legal stability. Law on State Regulation of Production and Turnover of certain types of Oil Products. This compels upstream producers to supply a requisite amount of oil to the domestic market rather than allowing total production to be exported to more lucrative markets. Law on Gas and Gas Supply which aims to prioritise the supply of commercial and LPG to the home market. Law on Subsoil and Subsoil Use which grants the state a right of pre­emption over shares in oil and gas/mining operations where there are new exploration and production projects.

Under Kazakh law the subsurface and the minerals found within it are deemed to be the property of the state. Mineral rights are held separately from land, with the mineral rights being granted under a concession agreement with the competent authority. Any oil and gas extracted under such an agreement belongs to the subsurface user, with a few exceptions (for example, that associated gas is the property of the state unless otherwise agreed in the concession agreement). The bulk of oil and gas reserves are privately held by the state, through KazMunayGas, holding proved reserves of 122.1 million tonnes (902 million barrels) or approximately 40% of total reserves.

Contracts are generally awarded on an exploration or a production basis. Occasionally they can be awarded for both. A handful of production­sharing agreements (PSAs) are also in operation, although these all date from before 2009. New PSAs are no longer entered into. It is not uncommon for the service contracts to contain obligations on the subsurface user to the benefit of the state, among these are that: The requirements that certain financial and work programme obligations are met. There is investment in local communities. An abandonment fund is created. Local products and services are met. Local personnel are hired and trained.

Offshore exploration contracts may also be extended for an additional two years even without discovery. On the occurrence of commercial discovery, negotiations begin with the state oil company to secure a production contract and, once entered into, the contracts are concluded for the period required for the depletion of any mineral reserves, subject to a 25­year limit, (45 years for larger or unique deposits). Production contracts can also be further extended by common consent. Combined contracts are only granted for deposits of strategic importance or for complex geological structures. F e e s In addition to any investment obligations under work programmes, subsurface users are subject to various taxes and other obligatory payments, such as a fixed one­time signature bonus to be paid by the subsurface user to the state as a condition of entering into a subsurface use contract during subsurface use operations.

The rate of the commercial discovery bonus is 0.1% of the calculation base. Historical cost reimbursements can generally be paid over the life of the production contract and are calculated based on the amounts previously paid to the state for geological exploration within the contracted area. These rates are calculated by reference to the Tax Code. Fees gathered from the social obligation clauses in the hydrocarbon contracts are used to benefit the local communities where the fields are found. A list of applicable taxes and obligatory payments can be found below at Question 9. L i a b i l i t y Subsurface users are liable for their own obligations under subsurface use contracts. Where there is a consortium or joint venture, the users are held to be jointly and severally liable. An operator must be appointed and a joint operating agreement that governs their mutual rights and obligations must be entered into. Kazakh legislation imposes a liability on any operations which cause damage to the environment, people's health, or third­party property owners. Strict liability is imposed for certain situations, for example where damage is caused by petroleum operations conducted offshore, subsurface activities within the 5km \"protection zone\" along the shoreline of the Caspian Sea or any \"source of heightened danger\". If there are more than two breaches of obligations under a subsurface contract or other relevant contract, the subsurface contract can be terminated if the breaches are not rectified within an appropriate time frame, as decided by the Ministry of Oil and Gas. R e s t r i c t i o n s There are a number of restrictions on subsurface users, as laid down by current legislation, these include: Having to obtain approval for the transfer of subsurface use rights or transfer of owner. Export quotas for petroleum. Having to obtain approval for investment in specific oil and gas infrastructure (acquiring more than 10% in a gas utility company will necessitate the approval of The Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Regulation of Natural Monopolies).

According to Subsurface Law, users must dismantle or remove any equipment and property used in connection with subsurface use operations, unless that equipment and property is transferred to another entity in accordance with written approval from the Ministry of Oil and Gas. The legislation also requires a detailed description of the process for the abandonment, or temporary abandonment, of any facilities used for subsurface use operations after the termination of operations. These facilities must be abandoned in accordance with the design documentation as approved by of the requisite state authorities. The abandonment process must first be approved by a commission established by the competent authority comprised of representatives from selected state bodies. Abandonment is only considered complete once the commission has signed an act of acceptance. The financing for abandonment primarily comes from an abandonment fund created by the subsurface user and is a special deposit account, at any bank in Kazakhstan.

The tax base can be adjusted if the authorities discover a deviation from the accepted market price range. Prices can also be affected by the customs union between Kazakhstan, Russia and Belarus. The three countries are currently considering a joint legislative framework for operations within the union (for example, the recently agreed uniform system of tariffs for the transportation of crude oil within the customs union). Under the 2012 Gas Law, prices for raw and commercial gas are determined by the subsurface user in accordance with the Rules on Determination of Prices for Raw and Commercial Gas to be acquired by the National Operator by Pre­emptive Right of the State.

The legislation governing the oil and gas industry has been subject to enormous change over the last few years, to reflect the Government's new energy policies. The adoption of the Subsurface Law in 2010 is regarded as being the catalyst for change in the oil and gas industry and has enabled the Government to press for amendments to hydrocarbon contracts and allow for the protection of the Kazakhstan's national security interests. Further reform followed in the gas industry by the transfer to the state of the rights to all associated gas, securing a supply of gas and gas products for the local market. This principle has been taken further by the 2012 Gas Law, setting out the exact conditions required for public private partnerships (PPPs) when looking to develop the gas supply infrastructure. The 2012 Gas Law also removes intermediaries from the gas supply chain by requiring gas to be transferred to either a PPP or to the national operator, if so desired by the Ministry of Oil and Gas. Following on from the adoption of the Gas Law, Kazakhstan's gas infrastructure now falls under the supervision of KazTransGas, the national gas pipeline operator. It has total authority to regulate and effectively control the gas infrastructure in Kazakhstan, as well as holding a pre­emptive right to purchase commercial gas and related infrastructure on behalf of the state.
